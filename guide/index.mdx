title: "Indexing"
description:
  "This document aims to outline the concept of indexing within the SDF CLI and outline a specific example to better articulate how to take advantage of this powerful feature."
---

It is recommended to store all models within a directory structure of 
`catalog/schema/table-name`. Following this structure, SDF auto-applies 
fully qualified names to the DDLs allowing for faster search and compilation. 

Within SDF, the process of indexing begins with the first `sdf compile` command. 
This creates an index of the local filesystem and workspace, allowing for files 
and dependencies to be mapped. The default index type, unless specified within 
the workspace, is set to `none`.

<Note>
In the following example, the `csv_123` sample workspace is used. If this workspace is not already
set up, it can be created with an `sdf new --sample csv_123` command.
</Note>

## Example

<Steps> 
  <Step title= "Basic Index">

Within a workspace.sdf.yml file, the index field can be updated to specify 
the type of index desired. In this example, the following csv_123 workspace 
can edited and utilized where index is specified as none. 


```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
   name: csv_123
   edition: "1.2"
   defaults:
     dialect: presto
   includes:
      - path: src
        index: none
      - path: local
        index: none
      - path: data
        type: resource
```
By setting the index value to `none`, every time you run `sdf compile` SDF begins a lookup to 
find the SQL defining the table in question. SDF begins by parsing a query, understands that it 
depends on another table and attempts to find the subsequent table. With indexing set appropriately,
 SDF knows exactly where the query files needed are stored. Comparitively, without indexing, or 
 indexing set to `none`, SDF has to scan until it located the query needed. 

In this example, the current directory is set to:

```bash
csv_123
├── data
│   └── a.csv
├── local
│   └── one.sql
├── remote
│   └── one.sql
├── src
│   ├── three.sql
│   └── two.sql
└── workspace.sdf.yml
```

And running an SDF compile results in a total run-time of 0.162 seconds:
```bash 
Working set 3 model files, 1 .sdf file
  Compiling example.pub.one (./local/one.sql)
  Compiling example.pub.two (./src/two.sql)
  Compiling example.pub.three (./src/three.sql)
   Finished 3 models [3 succeeded] in 0.162 secs
```
</Step>
<Step title= "Indexing at Scale with Catalog-Schema-Table-Name">

Utilizing the default index function of `none` for indexing works at reasonable scale, 
but when it comes to large organizations that have thousands of tables utilizing a different 
index function can drastically increase the speed of the process. 

Three other options are the following:

- `catalog-schema-table-name`
- `schema-table-name`
- `table-name`

Let's test the speed improvement by changing the index and directories:

Begin by specifying the index type to `catalog-schema-table-name` and defining defaults for the `catalog` and `schema`:
```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
   name: csv_123
   edition: "1.2"
   defaults:
    catalog: example
    schema: pub
    dialect: presto
   includes:
      - path: src
        index: catalog-schema-table-name
      - path: local
        index: catalog-schema-table-name
      - path: data
        type: resource
```

Making the above change to index, where we specify `catalog-schema-table-name` as 
the index type, requires that under `src` and `local` files are structured in a directories like  
`<catalog>/<schema>/<table-name>.sql`.
```bash
csv_123
├── data
│   └── a.csv
├── local
│   └── example
│       └── pub
│           └── one.sql
├── remote
│   └── one.sql
├── src
│   └── example
│       └── pub
│           ├── three.sql
│           └── two.sql
└── workspace.sdf.yml
```

<Note>
SDF workspaces default the catalog name to the workspace name specified in `workspace.sdf.yml`. It is 
important to add and update the `catalog` field within `defaults` of the `workspace.sdf.yml` file to reflect 
the appropriate catalog SDF will use for indexing. 
</Note>

Running `sdf compile` after making these changes and updating the index results in an improvemnet of total 
time to run, reducing down to less than 0.1 seconds. 

```bash 
Working set 3 model files, 1 .sdf file
  Compiling example.pub.one (./local/one.sql)
  Compiling example.pub.two (./src/example/pub/two.sql)
  Compiling example.pub.three (./src/example/pub/three.sql)
   Finished 3 models [3 succeeded] in 0.094 secs
```
</Step>

<Step title = "Indexing with Schema-Table-Name">

Another option, if your directories are set up as `<schema>/<table-name>` then you 
are able to use the index type schema-table-name. 

To test this example type, update the `workspace.sdf.yml` to reflect the new indexing types and update 
the folder directories to reflect this change. It is important to set the `catalog` within `defaults` on each 
of the includes paths. For example, add the `catalog` default to each path, `src` and `local` below. 
If the default catalog is not set in the top-level workspace block, the catalog will default to the workspace name.

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
   name: csv_123
   edition: "1.2"
   defaults:
    schema: pub
    dialect: presto
   includes:
      - path: src
        index: schema-table-name
        defaults:
          catalog: example
      - path: local
        index: schema-table-name
        defaults:
          catalog: example
      - path: data
```

```bash
Working set 3 model files, 1 .sdf file
  Compiling csv_123.pub.one (./local/pub/one.sql)
  Compiling csv_123.pub.two (./src/pub/two.sql)
  Compiling csv_123.pub.three (./src/pub/three.sql)
   Finished 3 models [3 succeeded] in 0.081 secs
```
</Step>
