The first step towards using SDF to transform queries in your warehouse is configuring a `provider`. Providers enable SDF to talk to your data warehouse and give you fine-grained controls over the databases, schemas, and tables that SDF can read and write to. 
Providers live as a subproperty of the [workspace block](/reference/sdf-yml#block-workspace), so a basic provider configuration will look like this:

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  ...
  defaults:
    compute: remote
  ...
  providers:
    - type: snowflake
      sources:
        - pattern: "w_source.*.*"
      targets:
        - pattern: "w_target.*.*"
```
<Warning>
  When `compute` is set to `remote`, a provider must be defined in the workspace. If no provider is defined, SDF will throw an error.
</Warning>

Simply put, this Snowflake provider would let SDF pull table metadata from the database `w_source` for compilation, then let SDF write and materialize tables to the database `w_target`.

<Tip>
  The provider above defaults to using a credential called `default`. This prevents you from having to add the `credential` property to the provider block if you only have one.
</Tip>

Sources and targets are configurable at the schema and table level, for example if I only wanted to pull the schema for a table called `my_table` in schema `schema1`, but I wanted to pull the schema for all tables in `schema2`, I would write:
``` yml
workspace:
    ...
    providers:
        - type: snowflake
          sources: 
            - pattern: db1.schema1.mytable
            - pattern: db2.schema2.*
    ...
```

### Multiple Providers

You can have multiple providers in a single workspace. This is useful when you have multiple data warehouses or databases that you want to hydrate tables from. For example, if you have a Snowflake and Redshift database, you can configure your workspace like so:

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  ...
  defaults:
    compute: remote
  ...
  providers:
    - type: snowflake
      credential: snowflake-creds
      sources:
        - pattern: "snowflake_source.*.*"
      targets:
        - pattern: "snowflake_target.*.*"
    - type: redshift
      credential: redshift-creds
      sources:
        - pattern: "redshift_source.*.*"
      targets:
        - pattern: "redshift_target.*.*"
```

In this example, we have two providers: one for Snowflake and one for Redshift. Each provider has its own set of sources and targets, and each provider uses its own set of credentials to authenticate with the respective data warehouse.

### Provider Configuration

Providers have a few key properties that you can configure:

- `type`: The type of provider you're using. This can be `snowflake` and `redshift` with `local` provider support coming soon.
- `credential`: The name of the credential you want to use to authenticate with your data warehouse. This is optional and defaults to `default`.
- `sources`: A list of patterns that SDF will use to hydrate table schemas from your data warehouse when it doesn't find them locally defined in SQL.
- `targets`: A list of patterns that SDF will use to materialize tables to your data warehouse when you run `sdf run`.

<Warning>
  All tables being materialized or output by SDF compilation or execution must match a target pattern. If a table does not match a target pattern, SDF will throw an error.
</Warning>
