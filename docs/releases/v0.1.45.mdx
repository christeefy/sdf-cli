### July 17th, 2023

We are excited to announce another release to our CLI which brings some exciting fixes, updates, and improvements to SDF.

### What's New?
- Introduced support for BigQuery dialect

- Added support for non-propagating classifiers
- Added support for table-level propagation
- Added support for recursive tables in lineage and propagation
- Added support for `.json` file format
- Added support for column aliases in `INSERT INTO` statements
