  edition: "1.2" # The edition of this workspace -- required
  description: 
    This workspace models the DBT / DuckDB Jaffle Shop example project. 
    The functionality of both DBT and DuckDB are encapsulated by SDF, as this project can be run entirely locally, with no external dependencies on data or compute providers.

    Try compiling first with `sdf compile`. This validates all SQL and dependencies are correct.
    Then, run everything locally with `sdf run`. This will run the entire DAG locally.
    Lastly, track lineage with `sdf lineage`. Specify the fully qualified name after the command to see lineage for a specific table of column.
  defaults:
    dialect: presto
    catalog: jaffle_shop
    schema: public
    preprocessor: jinja
    compute: local # Defaults to local, but included here to emphasize all compute is running on your local machine with the SDF Database powered by Apache DataFusion.
  includes:
    - path: src # The path to sql sources for this workspace -- at least one path is required
      index: schema-table-name # Infers the schema from the directory name, enabling faster compile and a more intuitive project structure.
    - path: data
      type: resource
