title: "Getting Started"
description: We're glad to see you here. Today we're going to install SDF and create a hello world project. Let's get started.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

## Installing SDF
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Binary Download">
    Our install script will first check your operating system and architecture,
    then install the latest version of SDF and its dependencies for your system.
    The `sdf` command will also be added to your path. 
    ```shell 
    curl -LSfs https://cdn.sdf.com/releases/download/install.sh | sh -s
    ```

  Alternatively, you can download and save the `install.sh` script to a
  local file and inspect it before passing to your shell for execution.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Verify Installation

To verify that SDF is installed correctly, run the following command:

```shell
sdf --help
```

```shell
SDF's modular SQL

Usage: sdf <COMMAND>

Commands:
  new        Create a new SDF workspace at PATH
  clean      Remove generated SDF artifacts in workspace
  build      Build, run, and save SDF queries
  describe   Describe inferred table schemas including propagated classifiers, run code code checks
  deploy     Create a deployment and post it to the SDF service
  view       View existing table content
  lineage    Display lineage for a given column
  system     System maintenance, install and update
  auth       Manage credentials and tokens
  analyze    Display results of various supported analyses (e.g. unused-columns)
  show       Generation of reference documentation: for CLI, metadata definition blocks, information schema and functions
  test       Generation of reference documentation: for CLI, metadata definition blocks, information schema and functions
  query      Generation of reference documentation: for CLI, metadata definition blocks, information schema and functions
  obfuscate  Obfuscate the workspace into the provided directory
  help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

```

For more on installing SDF, see [Install SDF](/guide/install). 

## Creating a Project

To create a new project, run the following command:

```shell
sdf new --sample hello
```
After running the command, you should see the following output: 
 
```shell
   Finished new in 0.001 secs
    Created hello/.gitignore
    Created hello/checks/code_check.sql
    Created hello/src/main.sql
    Created hello/workspace.sdf.yml


```

This will create a new directory with the name of your project. In this case, that's `hello`.
The directory will contain an `workspace.sdf.yml` file, which is the main configuration file for your project. For more on this, see our [workspaces guide](/guide/workspaces).
Your new directory will also contain a `src` directory with a `main.sdf` file, which is the entry point for your project and the sql file we'll be statically analyzing and executing locally.
Next, let's take a deeper look at your project.

## Exploring Your Project

Next we'll run the core command of SDF: [sdf describe](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-describe). 
Describing our project will *statically* analyze the query and tell you about the table schemas and column-level lineage. Building will run the query locally right on your machine.
Let's give them a go.

First we'll try `sdf describe`
  
```shell
cd hello/
sdf describe
```

```shell
Start parsing 2 files
  Analyzing hello.pub.code_check (./checks/code_check.sql)
  Analyzing hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)
------------
Summary [0.059s] 2 queries run: 2 passed

Schema hello.pub.main
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| column_name | data_type | classifier |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| column_1    | string!   |            |
| column_2    | string!   |            |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
Schema hello.pub.code_check
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| column_name | data_type | classifier |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| table_name  | string    |            |
| column name | string    |            |
| classifiers | string    |            |
+-------------+-----------+------------+

```


As you can see from the output, SDF has statically analyzed the query and determined there's a single non-nullable column named `column` and it's of type `varchar`. 
You'll also see an empty `classifier` block in the output. This is for metadata we'll attach to columns, but we'll get to that later.

In this guide we showed you just how easy it is to install SDF and run your first query.
