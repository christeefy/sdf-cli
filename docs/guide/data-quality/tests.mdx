## Understanding Tests
Tests are a commonly used data quality feature allowing you to scan results of queries and set *expectations* of your data. 
You can validate that a particular column is never null, or within a certain thresholding range, between a certain set of values, and more.

SDF Provides a standard [testing library](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sdf-std). The functions provided in the library are included natively in SDF.

<Note>All SDF Tests for all columns are compiled into table scans. This allows SDF to run multiple tests with a single scan. This dramatically reduces the cost of data tests.</Note>

There are three types of tests builtin.
- **Scalar Column Tests** - validate expectations of individual values in columns (eg. `x > 100` )
- **Aggregate Column Tests** - validate expectations of all values in a columns (eg. `sum(x) > 100` )
- **Table Tests** - validate expectations for all columns in table (eg. columns a and b are unique).

### Severity
Each test may be configured with a severity flag. By default all tests are have a severity of **error** meaning that a constraint violation will result in a non-zero exit code for sdf.

Tests may have three results, with text highlighting providing an indication of the output.

| Test Result | Meaning | 
| ------------|---------|
| ðŸŸ¢          | Passing | 
| ðŸŸ¡          | Warning | 
| ðŸ”´          | Failing | 

## Using a Test
Tests are added to columns in table blocks. Each column has 'constraints' and test functions should be expressed as the expectation you have of the column.

Test libraries are written as SDF workspaces that are imported by your workspace.

Below, we add a simple aggregate uniqueness test, and a scalar null values test to a `cool_column`.

``` yml
table:
  name: a_really_great_table
  columns:
    - name: cool_column
      constraints:
      - is: std.unique()
      - is: std.not_null()
        severity: warning
``` 

## SDF Standard Library Tests

### Column Tests

| Test Name                      | Type      | Description                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |----------------------------------------- |
| `not_null()`                   | Scalar    | Column elements must not be null |
| `valid_scalar(condition)`      | Scalar    | Column elements all meet scalar condition |
| `valid_aggregate(condition)`   | Aggregate | Column elements all meet aggregate condition |
| `unique()`                     | Aggregate | Column elements must be unique |
| `in_accepted_values([values])` | Aggregate | Column values are all elements of array |
| `minimum(value)`               | Aggregate | Column can not have values less than value | 
| `maxiumum(value)`              | Aggregate | Column can not have values greater than value |
| `exclusive_minimum(value)`     | Aggregate | Column can not have values less or equal to value | 
| `exclusive_maximum(value)`     | Aggregate | Column can not have values greater than or equal to value |
| `between(lower, upper)`        | Aggregate | Column values must be between lower and upper |
| `max_length(value)`            | Aggregate | Column can not have strings greater than value |
| `min_length(value)`            | Aggregate | Column can not have strings less than value |
| `like(string)`                 | Aggregate | Column elements must contain string |
| `try_cast(type)`               | Aggregate | Column elements must include string |
| `primary_key(column)`          | Aggregate | Column is primary key of column |

### Table Tests
| Test Name                      | Type      | Description                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |----------------------------------------- |
| `unique_columns([c1, c2])`| Table    | Table with columns `c1` and `c2` has unique values across these two columns |
