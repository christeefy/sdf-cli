## SDF User Permissions Reference

To better protect your data models and data warehouse, SDF provides role hierarchies for Organizations and Workspaces. 
Each SDF user has a Workspace role in each Workspace they belong to, plus a single Organization role. 

To reach these settings, navigate to Settings, select the Members tab, and then search for the desired member to update setting. 
In a drop down to the right, you are able to view and update the selected member's permissions and role.

## Organization Roles

An Organization role grants a user access to an SDF Organization, including all of the 
Workspaces within that Organization. All users have an Organization role regardless of whether they belong to a Workspace.
The following table lists the available Organization roles.
