### July 16th, 2024

We are excited to announce that a new minor release of our CLI is now available, bringing
 improvements, new features, and bug fixes to SDF. Interested in our product roadmap or want to 
discuss features? Reach out to your SDF point of contact to provide any points of feedback!

### SDF Now Supports Custom Scripts!

SDF now supports pre-compile, post-compile, pre-run, and post-run scripts, which let you trigger shell commands before or after `sdf compile` and `sdf run` respectively. 
In this way, you may string multiple commmands together, sequentially. Beyond this, custom scripts allow you to 
define scripts directly in your `workspace.sdf.yml` file and run them natively with SDF.

To execute any script run: `sdf exec <SCRIPT_NAME>`

Check out the new documentation: [Custom Scripts](/guide/advanced/custom_scripts)
