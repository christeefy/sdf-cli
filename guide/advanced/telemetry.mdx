title: "Understanding Telemetry"
---

SDF sends fully-anonymized telemetry to help us improve the tool by understanding how it is used. Telemetry is optional and can be disabled at any time.

  If you are willing and able to leave telemetry enabled, thank you! This will help us better understand how the CLI app is used, allowing us to improve your experience.

## What is tracked?

The following information is included in the telemetry events:

- Anonymous device ID
- Commands executed
- The start and end timestamps of a command execution
- Platform information (device details, operating system, CPU architecture, number of CPUs, total/available memory, etc.)
- Workspace metrics (dialect, number of models etc.) 
- Exit code and errors if there are any

We use telemetry for aggregate analysis and do not tie telemetry events to a specific identity.

## Disabling telemetry

You can disable the telemetry by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_SDF_CLI_TELEMETRY=1` before running the SDF.
