title: "Cloud Deployment"

Along with running workflows locally with sdf build, you can use `sdf push` to deploy your assets to the SDF Platform.

<Note>
The SDF Platform is only available via inquiry with our team at this time. If you'd like to get access, please [inquire](https://sdf.com/inquiries)
</Note>

Running push allows you to search, monitor and interact with your assets via SDF's cloud.

## What is Push?

SDF Push is just like running `sdf compile`, but with the intention of deploying your assets to the SDF Cloud.

<Info>
Before you can deploy your assets to the SDF Cloud, you'll need to authenticate with the platform. Follow our guide on [authentication](/guide/authentication) to get started.

## Deploying Your Workspace

Deploying your workspace is easy. All of the flags associated with the [sdf compile](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-compile) also work with push, but push has a few extra functionalities and tweaks to watch out for. Let's take a look at the following example:

> First, we'll [authenticate with the platform](/guide/authentication).
```shell
sdf auth login
```

> Next, let's create a sample project with the sample `deploy_sample`
```shell
sdf new deploy_sample
```

> Next, let's take a look at the workspace.sdf.yml file
```yaml
workspace:
  name: hello
  edition: "1.2"
  includes:
     - path: src/
```
> You'll notice that `name` is required. The `name` field is the name of your workspace.

> Now, let's push our tables to the SDF Platform
```shell
sdf push
```
