## Authenticating the CLI

Before you can deploy your assets to the SDF Cloud, you'll first need to authenticate with the platform. 

<Note>
The SDF Cloud is only available via inquiry with our team at this time. If you'd like to get access, please [inquire](https://sdf.com/inquiries)
</Note>

Authenticating with your CLI is easy. Simply run the command below to begin:

```shell
sdf auth login
```

Next, your default browser should pop up and prompt you to login with Google. If you don't have a Google account, you can create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).

Once you've logged in, you'll be redirected to a page that looks like this:

Congratulations! You've successfully authenticated with the SDF Platform. You can now deploy, monitor, and interact with your assets on the platform.
