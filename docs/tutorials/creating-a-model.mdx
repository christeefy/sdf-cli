title: "Creating a Model"
description:
  "Our first model in SDF, that's exciting!"
---

## Overview
Imagine your mom is trying to optimize marketing campaigns for mobile app 
installations, because she's proudly running a tech-forward boutique flower shop.
She wants to get some metrics per campaign to examine their performance. 


To help your mom, you plan to create a new table in the analytics layer called `dim_marketing_campaigns`.

In short, creating a new model using SDF is as simple as two basic steps:
1. Create a SQL file with the query of the model
2. Run `sdf run`

Let's check it out!

<Note>
    In this series of tutorials, we will execute our queries locally using SDF's built-in infrastructure. 
    To learn more about using other providers see our [providers guides](/integrations/snowflake/getting-started).
</Note>

## Prerequisites
1. A Mac or Linux with a valid installation of the latest SDF version running locally.
2. Completion of the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started).

  A complete version of the workspace (after the tutorials) is available in [this GitHub project]() for you 
  to follow along these guides if you wish.

## Guide
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a New Analytics Layer Model">
        To create a new model in SDF, all you need to do is to create a new SQL file.
        To follow best practices, we will create the model in the `models/analytics` directory.

        Create a file called `dim_marketing_campaigns.sql` under `models/analytics` and copy the SQL below.
        
        <Tip>
            Note that SDF can infer dependencies and other information from SQL natively 
            with no special adjustments needed from you. We do not require Jinja refs, sources
            definitions or additional configurations.
            
            Just write your SQL as you would run it.
        </Tip>
        

        ```sql models/analytics/dim_marketing_campaigns.sql
        SELECT 
            -- marketing campaigns dimensions
            m.campaign_id,
            m.campaign_name,
            -- metrics
            i.total_num_installs,
            total_campaign_spent / 
                NULLIF(i.total_num_installs, 0) AS avg_customer_acquisition_cost,
            campaign_duration / 
                NULLIF(i.total_num_installs, 0) AS install_duration_ratio
        FROM marketing_campaigns m
            LEFT OUTER JOIN stg_installs_per_campaign i
            ON (m.campaign_id = i.campaign_id)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Validate the Model Through Static Analysis">
        In just one command, SDF will analyze our entire data warehouse and provide immediate
        feedback. Through this static analysis we can fix our query or DAG before sending it to 
        run, saving time and compute.
        
        <Note>
        To run SDF commands your terminal should execute from the workspace's root folder - `moms_flower_shop`.
        
        If not already there, run `cd moms_flower_shop` in your terminal.
        </Note>
        
        Let's compile the workspace:

        ``` shell
        sdf compile
        ```

        A successful run will show all our models in their order of execution. 
        
        SDF intelligently caches previous compiles. Since we compiled the source models 
        under `models/raw` in the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started#), 
        those will not be re-compiled in this run. If you'd like to re-compile all files, 
        you can clear SDF's cache by running `sdf clean`. 
        
        It will look like this:
       
``` shell
Working set 11 model files, 8 .sdf files
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.raw_addresses (./models/raw/raw_addresses.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.raw_marketing_campaign_events (./models/raw/raw_marketing_campaign_events.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.raw_customers (./models/raw/raw_customers.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.raw_inapp_events (./models/raw/raw_inapp_events.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.marketing_campaigns (./models/staging/marketing_campaigns.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.inapp_events (./models/staging/inapp_events.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.app_installs_v2 (./models/staging/app_installs_v2.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.app_installs (./models/staging/app_installs.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.agg_installs_and_campaigns (./models/analytics/agg_installs_and_campaigns.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.customers (./models/staging/customers.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.stg_installs_per_campaign (./models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql)
   Finished 11 models [11 succeeded] in 0.838 secs

        ```

        We will see how it looks like when this command fails in later tutorials. 
        <Note>
            `sdf compile` will always be executed before `sdf run` so this step is not mendatory 
            to enjoy the benefits of SDF's static analysis. However, we think it provides additional 
            insights into our workspace that are worth noting.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the Query">
        Now that we validated our query, let's see its results.
        
        All we need to do is execute `sdf run` in our terminal. To only run our table, 
        we will indicate its name in our command.

        ```shell 
        sdf run dim_marketing_campaigns
        ```

        Notice that to execute our query, SDF ran all the models it is dependent on.

``` shell
Working set 12 model files, 8 .sdf files
    Running moms_flower_shop.pub.raw_inapp_events (./models/raw/raw_inapp_events.sql)
    Running moms_flower_shop.pub.raw_marketing_campaign_events (./models/raw/raw_marketing_campaign_events.sql)

</Steps>

Congratulations! You just created the your first model using SDF!

## Next Steps
**Our work here isn't done!**

As you look at the results of the query you realize that the `total_num_installs` 
column just doesn't make sense. 

Of course, your query is perfect! So what could've possible gone wrong?
Let's debug together using SDF in our [debugging tutorial](/tutorials/debugging).
