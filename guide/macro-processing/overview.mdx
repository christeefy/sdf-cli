title: "Macro Processing with SDF"
description:
  "SDF supports several macro processing features out of the box that enable compilation of queries containing Jinja and SQL Variables."
---

Macro Processing is critical to implementing DRY patterns, simplifying query writing, and enabling dynamic query generation.

SDF supports two types of macros:

1. **Jinja Macros** - Similar to other frameworks like DBT and Airflow, SDF supports Jinja macros for templating and dynamic query generation.
2. **SQL Variables** - Modeled after SQL Variables common in SQL dialects like [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language), SDF supports SQL Variables for parameterizing queries.

Both of these are preprocessed before compilation and execution.
