## Understanding Code Reports
SDF supports Code Reports which are a useful way to track & analyze datatypes, metadata, and business logic throughout your data warehouse. Code reports are expressed as SQL queries against the SDF Information Schema, similar to Code Contracts. Since code reports are generated with Static Analysis, executing them is fast.
Code Reports are simply small SQL queries that run against this information schema and enable you to analyze your warehouse and metadata. Some examples of effective code reports are:

 - Analyze Privacy Compliance: Get a list of all tables and columns that contain PII
 - Create a Data Deletion Report: Improve your data deletion capabilities by tracking retention and writing a code report to find all tables that contain PII and are past their retention period.
 - Run a Dead Column Analysis: Optimize your warehouse by computing a list of all columns that have no dependencies, then remove them to save on storage and compute costs.
<Note>
  A Code Report is very similar to a Code Contract. A Code Contract is a specialized Code Report where the expected result of the report is empty.
  In this way, Code Reports can be thought of as variables reflecting the state of your warehouse. These variables can then be used to power a code contract. 
</Note>
## Writing Your First Code Report
Let's write and modify a code report, starting with one of the sdf samples.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new SDF Project">
    ```shell
    sdf new --sample pii_saas_platform
    ```

```shell
    Created pii_saas_platform/.gitignore
    Created pii_saas_platform/classification/taxonomy.sdf.yml
    Created pii_saas_platform/classification/users.sdf.yml

    Created pii_saas_platform/workspace.sdf.yml
   Finished new in 0.002 secs

```
    This sample contains a Code Report and a workspace modeled after a simple SAAS platform.

    Notice the Code Report in the `reports` directory. This Code Report simply lists all tables with PII. It's configured in the `workspace.sdf.yml` file with [includes type](/reference/sdf-yml#enum-includetype) `code-report` on line 16 like so:
    ```yml
    workspace:
      name: hello
      ...
      includes:
        ...
        - path: reports
          type: code-report
    ```

    The Code Report itself lists all tables with PII by fetching all columns with classifiers that have `PII`. This is done with the following SQL:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      t.table_ref, 
      t.description, 
      t.dialect
    FROM 
      sdf.information_schema.tables t
    JOIN 
      sdf.information_schema.columns c ON t.table_ref = c.table_ref
    WHERE c.classifiers LIKE '%PII%'
    GROUP BY 1,2,3;
    ```

    <Info>
      Both Code Contracts and Code Reports must be written in the Presto SQL dialect.
    </Info>

    This report will show us tables that contain PII only because we defined a classifier like so:
    ```yml
        classifier:
        name: PII
        labels: 
          - name: name
          - name: email
          - name: phone
    ```

    As such, this code report will show tables that contain columns with any instance of the PII classifier (i.e. `PII.name`, `PII.email`, or `PII.phone`).

    <Note>
      SDF stores the `classifiers` on a column as a string. As such, we can use the SQL `LIKE` operator to search for a substring.

CodeReport sdf.reports.tables_with_pii

| transformations.internal.users_per_domain    |                         | snowflake |
+----------------------------------------------+-------------------------+-----------+
4 rows.

```

    As you can see from the output, it looks we have three tables containing columns with PII. Let's say we also wanted to show the names of the columns that contain PII. We can do this by modifying the SQL query to include the column name like so:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      t.table_ref, 
      c.column_name,
      t.description, 
      t.dialect
    FROM 
      sdf.information_schema.tables t
    JOIN 
      sdf.information_schema.columns c ON t.table_ref = c.table_ref
    WHERE c.classifiers LIKE '%PII%'
    GROUP BY 2,1,3,4;
    ```

    Now, when we run the report, we can see the column names as well:
    ```shell
    sdf report
    ```
```shell

7 rows.

```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New Code Report">
    Let's say we'd like to extend our analysis a bit but still maintain the original report. We can do this by adding a new Code Report to the `reports` directory. Let's add a new report to find the most frequently used datatypes in columns with PII. We can do this with the following SQL:
    ```sql
      SELECT c.data_type, COUNT(*) as frequency
      FROM sdf.information_schema.columns c
      WHERE c.classifiers LIKE '%PII%'
      GROUP BY c.data_type 
      ORDER BY frequency DESC;
    ```
    Now, when we run the report, we can see the most frequently used datatypes in columns with PII:
    ```shell
    sdf report
    ```
```shell
Working set 12 model files, 2 report files, 3 .sdf files
  Reporting sdf.reports.pii_datatypes (./reports/pii_datatypes.sql)
  Reporting sdf.reports.tables_with_pii (./reports/tables_with_pii.sql)
   Finished 12 models, 2 reports in 0.717 secs

1 rows.

CodeReport sdf.reports.tables_with_pii
+----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------+-----------+
| table_ref                                    | column_name  | description             | dialect   |
+----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------+-----------+
| transformations.external.invoice_stats       | email        |                         | snowflake |
| payment.public.users                         | name         | DDL for the users table | snowflake |
| transformations.external.invoice_stats       | name         |                         | snowflake |
| transformations.internal.users_per_domain    | email_domain |                         | snowflake |
| payment.public.users                         | email        | DDL for the users table | snowflake |
| payment.public.users                         | phone        | DDL for the users table | snowflake |
| transformations.internal.most_frequent_payer | email        |                         | snowflake |
+----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------+-----------+
7 rows.

```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Output (Optional)">
    We can save the output of a Code Report to a file by using the `--format` flag. Let's save the output of our reports to a file called `sdf_reports.csv`:
    ```shell
    sdf report --format csv > sdf_reports.csv
    ```
