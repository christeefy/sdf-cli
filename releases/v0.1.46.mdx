### July 31st, 2023

We released another version of the CLI which contains many updates, bug fixes, and other improvements to SDF.

### What's New?
- Introduced support for BigQuery arrays, binder, and parser
- Refactored and improved BigQuery types with additional support for lexical identifiers
- Improved the logout experience when a user is not logged in
- Added in-line documentation for initializing a new SDF workspace and running `sdf describe`
- Added exit code propagation to SDF describe. This means when sdf describe fails it will return a non-zero exit code, making it useful in CI/CD use cases.
- Added support for reclassification on the `function` block in `sdf.yml` files. This enables users to reclassify a classifier for all instances of a function.
- General bug fixes and stability improvements
