We are excited to announce that a new minor release of our CLI is now available, bringing
 improvements, new features, and bug fixes to SDF. Interested in our product roadmap or want to 
discuss features? Reach out to your SDF point of contact to provide any points of feedback!

### General bug fixes and stability improvements:
- Added table-origin to Information Schema
- Updated fixes for Reports tab within SDF Cloud, including pagination support to Table components and internal tests
- Added support for configurable logging infra using JSON, example: `sdf compile --log-level trace  --no-cache --show none`
- Implemented sdf man event-schema for defined event schema and validator for logs
- Fixed error with combined sql/jinja code where jinja preprocessor was breaking query parsing
