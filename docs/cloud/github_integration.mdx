title: "Integrating with Github"
---

## Overview

After completing this integration, your SDF cloud workspace will stay in sync with your GitHub repository. This means new Git commits to the SDF workspace in code will be automatically pulled and compiled ensuring the SDF Cloud catalog always stays up to date.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with access to the desired repository.
- Appropriate permissions on the repository to grant access.
- Necessary roles within the cloud platform to configure integrations.

<Note>
If you installed the SDF Github app before integrating with Github in the SDF cloud, you will need to delete the app, then integrate with Github through SDF for the integration to succeed.
</Note>


## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to the Integrations and Link Github">
        - Navigate to your SDF global settings and [locate the "Integrations" tab](https://console.sdf.com/catalog/settings/integrations) in the menu. Next, select the option to "Link Github". 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize SDF with GitHub">
    <img src="https://cdn.sdf.com/img/install_github_app.png"/>
        - You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize SDF to interact with your GitHub account. This step involves granting permission for SDF to act on your behalf, access resources, and verify your GitHub identity. Once SDF is authorized to work with Github, you will be able to select the repository or repositories you want to integrate with the cloud platform and grant access.
        <Note>
            If you do not have the right permissions to install SDF in your repository, then you will need to request approval for installation from an account admin and wait for that approval to go through. 
        </Note>
        <Warning>
            We only support connecting to one GitHub account per SDF organization, so if you have access to multiple GitHub organization accounts plus your personal account, you should select the GitHub account that all developers of your SDF organization have proper access to.
        </Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect Your GitHub Workspace">
        - After granting access, you will be redirected back to the cloud platform and should see that the integration was successful. You will now be able to connect a Github workspace. Once you begin the flow, you will be prompted to fill in the following fields:
            - **Repository**: Select the repository you are integrating this workspace with.
            - **Branch**: Input the branch you want to synchronize.
            - **Path**: Input the path to the `workspace.sdf.yml` file in your designated repository.
                - For example, if the repository looks like the output below:
                    - Then, to connect workspace 1, no input is necessary since the default path is the repository root.
                    - And to connect to workspace 2, the path would be `Workspace2foldername/` 
    <div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
    <pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
        <code>
            Repo Name
            ├── Workspace 1 Files
            ├── Workspace2foldername
            │   └── workspace.sdf.yml
            └── workspace1.sdf.yml
        </code>
    </pre>
    </div> 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Workspace Credentials and Environment Variables">
        - Optionally, you will be prompted to input workspace credentials and environment variables/secrets while connecting your Github workspace. Access the 
[Adding Workspace Credentials Guide](/cloud/credentials) or the [Configuring Environment Variables and Secrets Guide](/cloud/environments) to learn more.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sync GitHub and View your Integration">
        - Once the fields are properly filled in, click the 'Sync GitHub' button to synchronize your GitHub repository with the cloud platform. If you need to make changes, click 'Edit Configuration' to go back to GitHub and adjust your settings. Once synced, you will see the integration in the console. If you wanted to delete the integration, click the 'Settings' icon and select 'Delete'.
        <Note>
            When we say "synchronize" this just means the SDF cloud is running `git pull` under the hood to fetch the latest changes from the main branch.
        </Note>
        <Warning>
            When you sync your workspace with Github you will no longer be able to utilize the `sdf push` command to see the latest deployment for that specific workspace. 
        </Warning>
    </Step>
</Steps>
    

## Troubleshooting
- **Authorization Fails:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions on GitHub and try again.
- **Permission Issues:** Verify that you have granted access to the correct repositories.
- **Integration Not Appearing:** Refresh the page and check the integration settings.
- **Compilation Failed:**[Check the logs for your workspace](https://console.sdf.com/catalog/logs/default) to find more extensive information on why compilation failed. You may need to re-sync with Github or recompile your workspace first. Finally, check the [Github Status page](https://www.githubstatus.com/) to make sure Git systems are operational.
