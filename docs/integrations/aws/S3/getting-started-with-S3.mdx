description: "SDF supports connection to AWS S3"

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps of creating an AWS S3 integration. By the end, 
you will be able to reference remote S3 objects in SDF as if they were locally defined!

SDF will use remote S3 schema information to do type bindings, column level lineage, 
and other static analysis checks on your workspace.

## Guide using an IAM access_key and secret_key

<Steps>
    <Step title="Collect Required Information">
        To connect to S3 via IAM credentials, you need a valid keypair with the minimum credentials to read objects from your S3 Object Storage.
        * `access_key` the access key of your IAM profile
        * `secret_access_key` the secret key of your IAM profile
        * `region` containing the S3 objects

        <Note>
	        Run `sdf auth login aws --help` to see all login options.
        </Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Register the User in the AWS CLI">
    To begin, you need to register your user with the AWS CLI. 
    You can optionally provide a profile name. As default region, please use the AWS region 
    that your S3 bucket is located in. 

    The example below configures a profile called *S3*
    ``` shell
    aws configure --profile S3  
    ```
    
    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect SDF to AWS">
        Connect SDF to AWS by telling SDF which of your AWS profiles to use.
        ``` shell
        sdf auth login aws --profile S3 --default-region <REGION>
        ```

        <Info>
        This will create a new [credential](/reference/sdf-yml#block-credential) in 
        a `~/.sdf/` directory in the root of your system. This credential will be used 
        to authenticate with AWS services. By default, the credential's name is default. 
        As such, the credential does not need to be explicitly referenced in the integrations 
        configuration below.
        </Info>

        To validate the connection, run:
        ```shell
        sdf auth status
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add S3 Integration in your SDF Workspace">
        Once authenticated, add an integrations block in your `workspace.sdf.yml` 
        workspace block. This tells SDF to reference S3.
        
        ``` yml
        ---
        workspace:
            ...
            integrations:
                - provider: S3
                  type: data
                  bucket: 
                    - uri: <LOCATION>
                      region: <REGION>
        ```

        For more information on SDF integrations, see the [integration documentation](/guide/setup/integrations).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Try it out!">
        Now that you're connected, let's make sure SDF can pull the schema information it needs. 

        Run `sdf compile -q "select * from <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.<TABLE>" --show all`

        If the connection is successful, you will see the schema for the table you selected.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
    The ARN you created also needs user access to the database. Depending on your 
    DBs Access Policy, you might also have to give explicit access to
    this new user for this S3 bucket. You can do this through by adding 
    the ARN user to the appropriate group:
</Warning>

## Troubleshoot Resources
1. **Seeing errors like this `ERROR: permission denied for schema schema1` from `sdf run`?**

    This may be due to the user not having the correct permissions to this schema.
    To check if you have the right access, you can run the following query.

    Use `SVV_SCHEMA_PRIVILEGES` to view the schema owner, and schema_acl which shows the access control list for the schema.
    ```sql
    SELECT schema_owner, schema_acl FROM SVV_ALL_SCHEMAS WHERE schema_name = 'schema1';
    ```

    If your user does not have access to the schema, you can grant access to the schema by running the following query.
    To run this query, you either have to be a superuser or the owner of the schema.
    ```sql
    GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA schema1 TO <username>;
    ```

    The `<username>` is the user name of your IAM user, with `IAM:` prefix. For example, if your IAM user name is `my_user`, you can run:
    ```sql
    GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA schema1 TO "IAM:my_user";
    ```
