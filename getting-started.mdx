title: "Getting Started"
description: We're glad to see you here. Today we're going to install SDF and create a hello world project. Let's get started.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

## Installing SDF
<Tabs>
  {/* TODO (elias): Move this into a separate component that works with preprocess. It's reused in install.raw.mdx and getting-started */}
  <TabItem value="bin" label="Binary Download">
    Our install script will first check your operating system and architecture, then install the latest version of SDF and its dependencies for your system. The `sdf` command will also be added to your path.<div style={{marginBottom: '15px'}}/>
    <CodeBlock language="shell">
        curl -LSfs https://cdn.sdf.com/releases/download/install.sh | bash -s 
    </CodeBlock>
    
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>

### Verify Installation

To verify that SDF is installed correctly, run the following command:

```shell
sdf --help
```

```shell
SDF's modular SQL

Usage: sdf <COMMAND>

Commands:
  new       Create a new SDF workspace at PATH
  clean     Remove generated SDF artifacts in workspace
  build     Build, run, and save SDF queries
  describe  Describe SDF table schemas
  deploy    Create a deployment and post it to the SDF service
  view      View existing table content
  lineage   Display lineage for a given column
  system    System maintenance and generation of reference documentation
  auth      Manage credentials and tokens
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

```

For more on installing SDF, see [Install SDF](/guide/install). 

## Creating a Project

To create a new project, run the following command:

```shell
sdf new --sample hello
```
After running the command, you should see the following output: 
 
```shell
    Created hello/.gitignore
    Created hello/src/main.sql
    Created hello/workspace.sdf.yml
   Finished new in 0.001 secs

```

This will create a new directory with the name of your project. In this case, that's `hello`.
The directory will contain an `workspace.sdf.yml` file, which is the main configuration file for your project. For more on this, see our [workspaces guide](/guide/workspaces).
Your new directory will also contain a `src` directory with a `main.sdf` file, which is the entry point for your project and the sql file we'll be statically analyzing and executing locally.
Next, let's take a deeper look at your project.

## Exploring Your Project

Next we'll run two core commands in SDF: [sdf describe](/guide/basics#sdf-describe) and [sdf build](/guide/basics#sdf-build). 
Describing our project will *statically* analyze the query and tell you about the table schemas and column-level lineage. Building will run the query locally right on your machine.
Let's give it a go.

First we'll try `sdf describe`
  
```shell
cd hello/
sdf describe
```

```shell
  Analyzing hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)

Schema hello.pub.main
+-------------+-----------+-------------+------------+
| column_name | data_type | is_nullable | classifier |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+------------+
| column_1    | varchar   | false       |            |
| column_2    | varchar   | false       |            |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+------------+
    Written .sdfcache/dbg/assembly.sdf.yml
   Finished describe in 0.235 secs

```


As you can see from the output, SDF has statically analyzed the query and determined there's a single non-nullable column named `column` and its of type `varchar`. 
You'll also see an empty `classifier` block in the output. This is for metadata we'll attach to columns, but we'll get to that later.

Next let's try `sdf build` to run the query locally.

```shell
sdf build
```

```shell
   Building hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)

Table hello.pub.main
+----------+----------+
| column_1 | column_2 |
+----------+----------+
| hello    | there    |
+----------+----------+
1 rows.

    Written .sdfcache/dbg/hello/pub/main
    Written .sdfcache/dbg/assembly.sdf.yml
   Finished build in 0.228 secs

```

That's right - SDF just ran the query locally on your machine, and yes it did take a tenth of a second. 
The output is a table with a single column named `column` and a single row with the value `hello`. This data was defined as a constant within the SQL file itself. 
In a real case, you'd be querying a data lake or warehouse, and we'd do some clever sampling work to cache the data locally so you could work with it fully local and offline.


In this guide we showed you just how easy it is to install SDF and run your first query. Next you can move on to our [SDF Basics](/guide/basics) guide to learn more about the SDF CLI and learn how to work with real data.
