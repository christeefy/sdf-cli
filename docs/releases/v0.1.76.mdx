### September 12th, 2023

We are excited to announce that a new release of our CLI is now available, bringing some exciting updates and improvements to SDF.

### What's New?
- Parallelization: Based on hardware and structure of the dag, performance increases up to 10X 
- Introduced the '--no-parallel' flag to turn off parallelism
- Introduced '--infer-function' flag which allows functions to be inferred instead of required
- Direct table access and refined CLI. New include path field `access-with:`. Supports direct access to ddls and queries, provided they follow a naming scheme. Allows workspaces to grow to 1+ mil. artifacts and still be fast
