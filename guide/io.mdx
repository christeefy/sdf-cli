title: "Display and IO"

One of the beloved parts of software engineering is how developers have managed to keep their development workflows contained to the terminal. So we thought - why not let the vim and emacs legends of the world develop data workflows in their natural habitat - the terminal. As such, SDF is designed to be a command line tool and can ideally keep the large majority of your data development contained to the terminal (and your IDE of choice). As a byproduct, we take output *seriously*. This guide will take you through how to configure your terminal environment to get the most out of SDF.

<Note>
Simply put, SDF allows you to specify its 
* *display formats*, as part of *CLI* options
* *input file format and location*, as part of an *external table specification*
* *output file format and location*, as part of the *data asset specification*, the latter also via the CLI
</Note>

## Display Options

SDF writes progress or results on stdout. It provides the developer with a variety of logging and output options to enable scripting, debugging, and other use cases.

### Command-line options 

There are 4 commandline options to control the output.

- `--show (all | progress | result | none)` - Print desired amount of information, i.e., produced tables.

  - `all` prints progress, results, and any warnings and errors
  - `progress` prints the progress of files as they are compiled
  - `result` prints the tables parsed and the schema assocaited
  - `none` prints nothing. This will also prevent the `Finished in [n] seconds` message from displaying at the end of stdout.

- `--log-level (trace | debug | info | warn | error)` - Print logs in various degrees.

  - `trace` prints internal state changes
  - `debug` prints more of the above, cache hits, etc
  - `info` prints internal progress, SQL statements being processed, logical
    plan being produced
  - `warn` prints warnings associated with the compile
  - `error` prints errors assocaited with the compile 

- `--format (table | csv | tsv | json | nd-json | yml)` - Specifies the table representation
  on stdout.

  - `table` is the normal ascii table representation.
  - `csv` is a CSV representation
  - `tsv` is a TSV representation
  - `json` is a JSON representation
  - `nd-json` is an ndJSON representation
  - `yml`, only available for `sdf compile`, is YAML representation

- `--limit <number>` - Limits the number of shown rows. Run with `--limit 0` to
  show all rows.

### Example

Let's try these options. Start by creating a new workspace with a sample project or change directories into an existing one.
<Steps>

  <Step title="Install and setup your workspace">
    To start with a sample workspace lineage 'new --sample lineage' will generate a new workspace folder to walk through this example.
    
    ```shell	
		sdf new --sample lineage
		```
    After running the command, you should see the folloing output:
    
```shell
    Created lineage/checks/check_sink_phone_is_pii.sql
    Created lineage/src/knis.sql
    Created lineage/src/middle.sql
    Created lineage/src/sink.sql
    Created lineage/src/source.sql
    Created lineage/workspace.sdf.yml
   Finished new in 0.002 secs

```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Directory">
    Switch directories into the newly created lineage workspace.
    
```shell	
cd lineage/
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compile lineage Workspace with --show command">
    Compile the workspace and review the output.
    
```shell	
sdf compile
```
    Reviewing this output, multiple files have been compiled and SDF has statically analyzed the queries.

```shell
Working set 4 model files, 1 .sdf file
  Compiling lineage.pub.source (./src/source.sql)
  Compiling lineage.pub.middle (./src/middle.sql)
  Compiling lineage.pub.knis (./src/knis.sql)
  Compiling lineage.pub.sink (./src/sink.sql)
   Finished 4 models [4 succeeded] in 0.133 secs

```

    Add the `--show all` command to display all information after compile

```shell
sdf compile --show all
```

    Reviewing this output, SDF provides progress and table information. SDF reuses model files that have already been compiled and have not been edited. 
```shell
Working set 4 model files, 1 .sdf file
   Finished 4 models [4 reused] in 0.113 secs

Schema lineage.pub.source
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| column_name | data_type | classifier |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| user_id     | integer   | DATA.uid   |
| phone       | varchar   | DATA.pii   |
| txn_date    | varchar   |            |
| qty         | integer   |            |

| user_id     | integer   | DATA.uid   |
| phone       | varchar   | DATA.pii   |

| qty         | bigint    |            |
+-------------+-----------+------------+

Schema lineage.pub.sink
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| column_name | data_type | classifier |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| uid         | integer   | DATA.uid   |
| phone       | varchar   | DATA.pii   |
| txn_date    | varchar   |            |
| qty         | bigint    |            |
+-------------+-----------+------------+

```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diplay a single sink table">
  To select the output of only one table, use the table name directly after the `compile` command.

  ```shell
  sdf compile src/sink.sql
  ```

  <Note>
      The `compile` command can take targets in multiple formats.
      * `sdf compile catalog.schema.table_name` *using fully qualified name*
      * `sdf compile table_name` *using table name and inferred fully qualified name*
      * `sdf compile /path/to/table_name.sql` *using file path*
      * `sdf compile catalog.*.*`  *using glob pattern to compile multiple targets*
      * `sdf compile [No params]` *using no params compiles the whole workspace*
  </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>  
### Schema

The `schema` of an external table must be given **explicitly**, following the [ANSI standard SQL syntax](https://blog.ansi.org/2018/10/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2016-ansi-x3-135/) or

An example for an explicit table definition looks like this

```sql
create external table events (
    dt date not null,
    action varchar not null,
    user_id smallint not null)
    ...
```

Besides column names, types and nullability, SDF schema definitions have no
other schema descriptions, no foreign keys, no constraints.
