title: "Getting Started"
description: We're glad to see you here. Today we're going to install SDF and create a hello world project. Let's get started.
---

## Installing SDF
Installation is currently by invitation only. If you'd like to try SDF, please [request a demo](https://www.sdf.com/inquiries).

### Verify Installation

To verify that SDF is installed correctly, run the following command:

```shell
sdf --help
```

``` shell
SDF's modular SQL

Usage: sdf <COMMAND>

Commands:
  new      Create a new sdf workspace
  clean    Remove artifacts that sdf has generated in the past
  compile  Compile models
  run      Run models
  test     Test your models
  stats    Statistics for your data
  report   Report code quality
  check    Check code quality
  ai       Infer metadata like classifiers and add them optionally to the workspace
  lineage  Display lineage for a given table and/or column
  push     Push a local workspace to the SDF Service
  system   System maintenance, install and update
  auth     Authenticate CLI to services like SDF, AWS, OpenAI, etc
  man      Display reference material, like the CLI, dialect specific functions, schemas for authoring and interchange
  dbt      Initialize an sdf workspace from an existing dbt project
  lsp      
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

```

## Creating a Workspace

To create a new SDF Workspace, run the following command:

```shell
sdf new --sample hello && cd hello
```
After running the command, you will see the following output: 
 
``` shell
    Created hello/.gitignore
    Created hello/src/main.sql
    Created hello/workspace.sdf.yml
   Finished new in 0.110 secs

```

This will create a new directory with the name of your workspace. In this case, that's `hello`. Feel free to change it to whatever you'd like, as long as the name is a valid SQL identifier.

Your workspace directory will contain a `src` directory with a single `main.sql` file containing a single statement. The directory will also contain a `workspace.sdf.yml` file, which is the primary configuration file for your project. For more on this, see our [workspaces guide](/guide/workspaces).
The workspace YAML file has a reference to the `src` directory via the `include` clause. 

Next, let's take a deeper look at your project.

<Note>
SDF uses a cache to fingerprint outputs and accelerate recomputation. This cache is by default located in the `.sdfcache/` directory.
The cache machine specific and should not be checked in to git. An appropriate `.gitignore` file is created as part of the `sdf new` command.
</Note>

<Info>
    We refer to SQL statements in SDF as `models`. Models are SQL statements that will materialized in your data warehouse, or locally with the SDF DB. They differ from tables
    as they can be materialized as tables, views, and more based on the configuration. Furthermore, they can be templatized with jinja and SDF SQL variables. SDF recommends specifying one model per file, as each model receives a fully qualified name (`database.schema.table`) that can correspond nicely to a directory structure.
    See our [indexing documentation](/guide/advanced/index) for more.

## Exploring Your Project

Let's see just how easy it is to set up SDF and run your first query.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Static Analysis with `sdf compile`">        
        First, we'll run the core command of SDF: [sdf compile](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-compile). 
        
        The `--show` flag allows you to modulate SDF's output and the `all` option indicates that we would like to see all schemas from all models referenced in the workspace.
        ```shell
        sdf compile --show all
        ```
         
        Your output should look like:
``` shell
Working set 1 model file, 1 .sdf file
  Compiling hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)
   Finished 1 model [1 succeeded] in 0.232 secs

Schema hello.pub.main
┌─────────────┬──────────────────┬────────────┬─────────────┐
│ column_name ┆ data_type        ┆ classifier ┆ description │
╞═════════════╪══════════════════╪════════════╪═════════════╡
│ column_1    ┆ varchar not null ┆            ┆             │
│ column_2    ┆ varchar not null ┆            ┆             │
└─────────────┴──────────────────┴────────────┴─────────────┘

        ```

        As you can see from the output, SDF has statically analyzed the query and determined there's a single non-nullable column named `column` and it's of type `varchar`. 
        You'll also see an empty `classifier` block in the output. This is for metadata we'll attach to columns, but we'll get to that later.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Execution with `sdf run`">
        Next, let's execute the query, using SDF as the database. We'll execute the query with SDF's integrated execution runtime, right on your machine.
        
        ```shell
        sdf run --show all
        ```

        Your output should look like:
``` shell
Working set 1 model file, 1 .sdf file
    Running hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)
   Finished 1 model [1 succeeded] in 0.190 secs

Table hello.pub.main
+----------+-----------------+
| column_1 | column_2        |
+----------+-----------------+
| hello    | Jeffrey Walters |
+----------+-----------------+
1 rows.

        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a New Model">
        Now, create a new file in the source directory called `main2.sql` with the query:

        ```sql main2.sql
        SELECT * FROM main;
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Lineage with `sdf lineage`">
        SDF guarantees rich column level lineage. The command below specifies a particular column, in a particular table that we would like to inspect.
        
        ```shell
        sdf lineage main2 --column column_1
        ```

``` shell
Working set 2 model files, 1 .sdf file
  Compiling hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)
  Compiling hello.pub.main2 (./src/main2.sql)
   Finished 2 models [2 succeeded] in 0.190 secs
main2.column_1
│
│ copy
└──────┐
       main.column_1

        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

In this guide we showed you just how easy it is to install SDF and run your first query.

<Tip>
    If using VSCode, SDF's YML schema is available for type and syntax checking via the [Red HAT YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml). This will
    add auto-fill, type checking, and YML validation directly inline while editing `sdf.yml` files.
