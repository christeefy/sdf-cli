### January 10th, 2024

We are excited to announce that a new release of our CLI is now available, bringing some exciting updates and improvements to SDF.

### What's New?

#### Introducing `compile` command

`sdf compile [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]…`command is used to compile models and parse files within the directory. It will statically analyze and return a summary of the actions completed. This replaces `sdf describe`.

This command defaults to `--no-show` and will return the following:

```sql
Start parsing 1 files
  Analyzing hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)
------------
Summary [0.164s] 1 query run: 1 passed
```

To view the results of the compiled modules and produced tables you can either add —show or specify a target.

`sdf compile --show`

```sql
Start parsing 1 files
------------
Summary [0.114s] 1 query run: 1 passed

Schema hello.pub.main
+-------------+------------------+-------------+
| column_name | data_type        | classifier  |
+-------------+------------------+-------------+
| column_1    | varchar not null |             |
| column_2    | varchar not null | PII.name    |
| column_3    | varchar not null | PII.phone   |
| column_4    | varchar not null | PII.user_id |
+-------------+------------------+-------------+
```

#### Target via table name or as a block

When targeting a table or a block of tables, there are updates on how to best accomplish this. Similar to how typescript approaches targeting directories and folders, the following actions have the same effect of collecting all files within a specified target directory and sub-directories:

- `sdf compile catalog.schema.table`
- `sdf compile target_directory`
- `sdf compile target_directory/`
- `sdf compile target_directory/**/*`

To target files within a specific directory and no sub-directories, the following command is used:

- `sdf compile target_directory/*`

#### Deprecating Commands (describe and deploy)

The commands `describe` and `deploy` have been deprecated.
