### June 1st, 2023

We released a very exciting version of the CLI which contains many updates, bug fixes, and other improvements to SDF, but most importantly, Pyspark support.

With this release one can now run `sdf describe` and `sdf lineage` on workspaces with pyspark pipelines with the help of the new Pyspark plugin. Here is an example of how this functionality can be unlocked in a workspace definition file:
```
workspace:
  edition: "1.1"
  default-schema: scratch
  includes:
    - path : path/
---

plugin:
  name: pyspark
  binary: analyze_pyspark_pipeline.py
  extension: py
  format: spark-lp-json
```
Here `path` contains Python pipeline files with extension .py. The Pyspark plugin relies on the analyze_pyspark_pipeline.py script which accesses the user's Databricks cluster and downloads the metadata of all the tables in the specified cluster.

This is an alpha release. Known limitations include:
- Classifier propagation is not yet enabled for Pyspark tables
- The analyze_pyspark_pipeline.py script accesses all tables in a catalog sequentially, which is slow. We may parallelize this or allow the user to specify a subset of schemas/databases to access.

### What's New?
- PySpark support ðŸ˜„
- Introduced support for super types
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
