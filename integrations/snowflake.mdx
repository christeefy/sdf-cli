  "SDF can hydrate table schemas and execute queries against a Snowflake DB."

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps of creating a Snowflake integration. By the end, you will be able to reference tables in your snowflake instance in SDF.

SDF will use remote Snowflake schema information to do type bindings and other static analysis checks on your workspace.


## Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Collect Required Information">
        To connect to Snowflake, you need the following materials:
        * Account ID - the 8 digit organization identifier
        * Username - your Snowflake username
        * Password - your Snowflake password
        * Role - a role with appropriate permissions
        * Warehouse - The warehouse you are connecting to.

        Log in to your [Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/) account to find the relevant information.

        <Note>
	        Run `sdf auth login snowflake --help` to see all login options.
        </Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect SDF to Snowflake">
        Connect SDF to snowflake. SDF will prompt you for your Snowflake password.
        ``` shell
        sdf auth login snowflake --account-id <ACCOUNT_ID> --username <USERNAME> --role <ROLE> --warehouse <WAREHOUSE_NAME>
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Snowflake Provider in Workspace">
        Once authenticated, add a table provider block in your `workspace.sdf.yml`. This tells SDF to use Snowflake to hydrate missing table schemas.
        
        ``` yml
        ---
        table-provider:
          catalog: <DATABASE> 
          type: snowflake
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Try it out!">
        Now that you're connected, let's make sure SDF can pull the schema information it needs. 

        Run `sdf compile -q "select * from <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.<TABLE>" --show all`

        If the connection is successful, you will see the schema for the table you selected.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Some things to keep in mind
  - The term 'DATABASE' in Snowflake is interchangeable with the term 'CATALOG' in SDF.
