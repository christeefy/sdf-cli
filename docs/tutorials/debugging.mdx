## Overview
In the previous tutorial we learned how to [create a new model with SDF](/tutorials/creating-a-model).
As we were working on `dim_marketing_campaigns`, the result of the query just didn't make sense.

In this tutorial we will see how SDF can simplify complicated debugging scenarios and accelerate 
their resolution. It can also provide real-time feedback as you author your queries with unprecedented 
speed and accuracy.

More specifically, we will use SDF to:
1. Identify the issue upstream with our built-in column-level lineage.
2. Run impact analysis after fixing the issue.
3. Test some syntax static analysis examples

## Prerequisites
Completion of the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/creating-a-model).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Understand Column Lineage">
        SDF provides column-level lineage out of the box, all the way up to source.

        To understand the lineage of the column `total_num_installs` in our new model, all
        we need to do is run: 

        ```shell 
        sdf lineage dim_marketing_campaigns --column total_num_installs
        ```

<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }} className='language-shell'>
<code className='language-shell'>
dim_marketing_campaigns.total_num_installs
│
│ copy
└──────┐
       stg_installs_per_campaign.total_num_installs
       │
       │ mod
       └──────┐
              app_installs.event_id
              │
              │ copy
              └──────┐
                     inapp_events.event_id
                     │
                     │ copy
                     └──────┐
                            raw_inapp_events.event_id
                     raw_marketing_campaign_events.event_id

</code>
</pre>
 
        Now we can pinpoint exactly which models we need to check. Out of the entire warehouse, we only need to check 3 models!
 
        <Tip>
        To learn more about SDF lineage, visit our [lineage guide](/guide/basics/lineage_metadata)
        </Tip>
 
    </Step> 
    <Step title="Identify the Issue Upstream">
        Let's check the first upstream model -- `stg_installs_per_campaign.sql`
        located under the directory `models/staging/`.

        ``` sql models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql
        SELECT 
            campaign_id,
            COUNT(event_id) AS total_num_installs
        FROM app_installs
        GROUP BY 1
        ```

        There is not much going on here. We need to keep moving up.

        In the upstream model `app_installs` defined in `models/staging/app_installs.sql`,
        let's zoom in on the `FROM` statement:
        ``` sql models/staging/app_installs.sql
        ...
        FROM inapp_events i 
            LEFT OUTER JOIN raw_marketing_campaign_events m
                ON (i.event_id = m.event_id) 
        ...
        ```

        <Tip>
        **Aha!** Who said that inapp_events and marketing events are the same?
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Compare to Other Models">
        You remember another model, `customers`, has correct marketing campaign data. 
        Let's check out the lineage for the customers model:

        ```shell
        sdf lineage customers --column campaign_id
        ```

<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
customers.campaign_id
│
│ copy
└──────┐
       app_installs_v2.campaign_id
       │
       │ copy
       └──────┐
              raw_marketing_campaign_events.campaign_id

</code>
</pre>

        <Tip>
        **Aha #2!** There's a V2 version of `app_installs` -- `app_installs_v2`
        </Tip>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Update the Model">
        Once we identify the issue, it's an easy fix. 
        Update the `FROM` statement of `models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql`, to the use `app_installs_v2`:

        ``` sql models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql
        ...
        FROM app_installs_v2  -- Change from app_installs to app_installs_v2
        ...
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Analyze">
        Let's analyze the impact.

        First, we should make sure our fix compiles:
        ```shell
        sdf compile 
        ```

        We expect to see a successful run:

<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }} className='language-shell'>
<code className='language-shell'>
Working set 12 model files, 8 .sdf files
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.stg_installs_per_campaign (./models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql)
  Compiling moms_flower_shop.pub.dim_marketing_campaigns (./models/analytics/dim_marketing_campaigns.sql)
   Finished 11 models [2 succeeded, 9 reused] in 0.617 secs

</code>
</pre>

        Next, we can look at all the tables and columns this change will impact. If we add the 
        flag `--forward` to the lineage command, we will see the lineage of each column of 
        `stg_installs_per_campaign` and how it is used by other models.

        To do that, add a `forward` tag to your lineage command:
        ```shell
        sdf lineage stg_installs_per_campaign --forward
        ```

        It should look like this:
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }} className='language-shell'>
<code className='language-shell'>
Table: stg_installs_per_campaign

stg_installs_per_campaign.campaign_id

stg_installs_per_campaign.total_num_installs

│      dim_marketing_campaigns.total_num_installs
│ mod
└──────┐
       dim_marketing_campaigns.avg_customer_acquisition_cost
       dim_marketing_campaigns.install_duration_ratio


</code>
</pre>

        Only our new model will be impacted.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fix it!">
        To materialize the fix, all we need to do is run the queries:
        
        ```shell
        sdf run dim_marketing_campaigns
        ```

        Perfect! We are all set!

## Bonus
Lineage is not all we can do.

SDF provides out of the box static analysis to support the development
process as you author your transformations. This capability has two benefits:
1. Quicker development thanks to the instant feedback on your syntax and semantics
2. Compute cost savings since analysis happens on compile, before we send the query to run

Let's try a few things that **will fail**. In this case, getting an error early is a good thing.
Notice how quickly you get the response!

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open the File">
        To keep it simple, we will use `models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql`
        throughout the following steps.
        
        As a reminder, the query looks like this:

        ``` sql models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql
        SELECT 
            campaign_id,
            COUNT(event_id) AS total_num_installs
        FROM app_installs_v2
        GROUP BY 1
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Error: No Column Found">
        Let's try to change the column campaign_id to a non-existing column. 
        
        For example, we can change the column name from `campaign_id` to `non_existing_column`. 
        This column definitely doesn't exist in `app_installs_v2` (or `app_installs`)

        ```sql models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql
        SELECT 
            -- We changed campaign_id to non_existing_column below
            non_existing_column, 
            COUNT(event_id) AS total_num_installs
        FROM app_installs_v2
        GROUP BY 1
        ```
        If we try to compile:
        ```shell 
        sdf compile stg_installs_per_campaign
        ``` 

        The run will fail and the error message will look like this:

<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
error: SDF227: No column 'non_existing_column' found, available are 'app_installs.install_time', 'app_installs.campaign_name', 'app_installs.campaign_type', 'app_installs.campaign_id', 'app_installs.customer_id', ...
  --> models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql:2:5

</code>
</pre>

        <Tip>
            If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can easily click into the error location
            by CMD-Clicking on the bottom of the error:
            
            `--> models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql:2:5`
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Error: Function Arguments Do Not Match">
        Similarly, we can write a function incorrectly. 

        For example, the function `ABS` takes one numeric argument. What if we try to give it 
        a string like `campaign_name`? In the file `models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql`, 
        change the `campaign_id` selection with the following:
        
        ```sql models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql
        SELECT 
            -- We changed campaign_id to ABS(campaign_name) 
            ABS(campaign_name), 
            COUNT(event_id) AS total_num_installs
        FROM app_installs_v2
        GROUP BY 1
        ```

        If we try to compile:
        ```shell
        sdf compile stg_installs_per_campaign
        ```

        The run will fail and the error message will look like this:

<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
error: SDF209: Function ABS arguments do not match, actual varchar, candidates tinyint; smallint; bigint; double; decimal(p, s); real
  --> models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql:2:5

</code>
</pre>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Error: Un-aggregated columns in aggregation context">
        We can even try some more complicated logic. 
        
        For example, we can add another column to the `SELECT` without updating the `GROUP BY`. 
        ``` sql
        SELECT 
            campaign_id,
            campaign_name,  -- We added an extra column
            COUNT(event_id) AS total_num_installs
        FROM app_installs_v2
        GROUP BY 1  -- We didn't add the new column here
        ```

        Watch what happens when you try to compile:
        ```shell
        sdf compile stg_installs_per_campaign
        ```
        
        The run will fail and the error message will look like this:
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
error: SDF209: Function ABS arguments do not match, actual varchar, candidates tinyint; smallint; bigint; double; decimal(p, s); real
  --> models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql:2:5

</code>
</pre>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Try it Yourself">
        What is that one syntax mistake you always forget about until you see that 
        run error? Try it out! See if SDF can save you the wait next time :)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Don't Forget to Revert!">
        While experimenting, we introduced some breaking logic to our data warehouse.
        Let's revert the model to the original SQL code.

        Update the file `models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql` with the original SQL:

        ```sql models/staging/stg_installs_per_campaign.sql
        SELECT 
            campaign_id, 
            COUNT(event_id) AS total_num_installs
        FROM app_installs_v2
        GROUP BY 1
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Next Steps
Now that we fixed the issue, we want to prevent anything similar from happening again. 
In our next tutorial, "[Deprecating a Model](/tutorials/deprecating-a-model)" we will
deprecate `app_installs`, the old version of `app_installs_v2` that we initially used.
