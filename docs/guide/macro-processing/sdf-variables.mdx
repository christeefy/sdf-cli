  "Simple variables and parameterization in SDF"

SDF supports simple variables and parameterization in SQL queries. This is useful for dynamic queries and for reusing values in multiple queries. 
These differ from variables in Jinja in the following ways:

1. They are only available for use in SQL, not in YML.
2. They are typed (bool, int, float, string, and null)
3. They are used with the `@` syntax, instead of `\{\{ \}\}`
4. They can be easily set per run with the `--vars` flag on CLI commands like [`sdf compile`](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-compile) and [`sdf run`](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-run)

Let's go through a simple example where we use a variable in a SQL query.

## Example

In this example, we will create a variable `@my_variable` and use it in a SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = @my_variable
```

In order to enable variable substitution, we'll need to set the `preprocessor` option to `sql-vars` in the `workspace.sdf.yml` like so:
```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
     workspace:
        defaults:
          preprocessor: sql-vars
        ...
```

Next, to set the value of `@my_variable`, let's add a `vars` yml block to the workspace like so:
```yml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  defaults:
    preprocessor: sql-vars
  vars:
    my_variable: "my_value"
  ...
```

You can use the `--vars` flag on the CLI. For example:
```shell
sdf run --vars '{my_variable: "my_value"}'
```
or 
```shell
sdf compile --vars '{my_variable: "my_value"}'
```

This will replace `@my_variable` with `my_value` in the SQL query. The resulting query will look like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = 'my_value'
```

SDF vars also respect types, so if you set a variable to a number, it will be treated as a number in the SQL query. For example:
```shell
sdf run --vars '{my_variable: 123}'
```

This will replace `@my_variable` with `123` in the SQL query. The resulting query will look like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = 123
```

SDF vars also support boolean, float, and null types along with strings and integers.

### Vars in Jinja
SQL variables can also be referenced and utilized in Jinja. For example, if we modify the query above to use jinja substitution syntax, it would look like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = {{ my_variable }}
```

You can then set the variable in the `vars` block in the `workspace.sdf.yml` file like so:
```yml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  defaults:
    preprocessor: all
  vars:
    my_variable: "my_value"
  ...
```

<Note>
  If you want to use both Jinja and SQL vars in preprocessing, you'll need to set preprocessor to `all` in the workspace.sdf.yml as seen above.
</Note>

### Vars in YML

You can also set variables in a `vars.yml` file. This is useful when you have a lot of variables to set. Here is an example of a `vars.yml` file:   
```yaml vars.yml
my_variable: "my_value"
```

You can then use this file with the `--vars` flag like so:
```shell
sdf run --vars vars.yml
```

where `vars.yml` is the path to the file.
