## Overview
SDF supports macro processing with Jinja.

* Jinja Files - SDF requires macro definitions to be in .jinja files
* Preprocessor configuration - SDF Requires a workspace to turn on the jinja preprocessor
* SDF provides some built in functions

## Getting Started With Jinja
Let's explore some of the capabilities unlocked by using jinja in a minimal SDF workspace.
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new SDF Workspace">
        Create a new SDF workspace.
        `sdf new jinjex && cd jinjex`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Your Workspace to Use Jinja">
        Add a new preprocessor property to the *workspace* block in your `workspace.sdf.yml`
        ```yml workspace.sdf.yml
            workspace:
              name: jinjex
              defaults:
                preprocessor: jinja
              ...
        ```
        Congratulations! Your workspace is now configured to run with Jinja.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a Jinja Expression to main.sql">
        Replace the contents of /src/main.sql with a short jinja expression like:
        ```sql
        select 
        {% for i in range (1, 5)%}
        {{i}} as col_{{i}},
        {% endfor %}
        ;
        ```
        This expression creates a table with four columns. 
        
        **Compile**
        To see the schema, run: 
        
        `sdf compile main`

        ```shell
        Schema jinjex.pub.main
        +-------------+------------------+------------+
        | column_name | data_type        | classifier |
        +-------------+------------------+------------+
        | col_1       | integer not null |            |
        | col_2       | integer not null |            |
        | col_3       | integer not null |            |
        | col_4       | integer not null |            |
        +-------------+------------------+------------+
        ```

        **Run**
        To execute the SQL statement using SDF as the database target, simply run:

        `sdf run main`
        ``` shell
        Table jinjex.pub.main
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
        | col_1 | col_2 | col_3 | col_4 |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
        | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Creating a New Jinja Function">
        Let's create a new function. This function will be accessible globally in your workspace. To start, create a new folder `macros` and add a new file `macros.jinja` to the folder.

        Add the new directory to your includes in the workspace.

        ```yml workspace.sdf.yml
        workspace:
            ...
            includes:
            - path: src   
            - path: macros # <-- add this
            ...
        ```
        In your `macros.jinja` file add a new function which we'll call *switch_schema*

        ```jinja macros.jinja
        {% macro switch_schema(schema_name, table_name) -%}
            {%- if schema_name is none -%}
                {{ default_schema }}.{{table_name}}
            {%- else -%}
                {{schema_name}}.{{table_name}}
            {%- endif -%}

        {%- endmacro %}
        ```

        Macros by default inherit their namespace from the Workspace name, in this case **jinjex**
        To reference any macro defined in your workspace, specify it with the namespace like `jinjex.<function>(params)`

        Check that the function is included by running `sdf compile`. The output should be all green.
    </Step>  
    <Step title="Using the Jinja function">
        It's time to reference the function.
        Let's create a new SQL file, `child.sql` in the */src* folder.

        ```sql src/child.sql
        CREATE TABLE {{ jinjex.switch_schema("private", "child") }}
        AS
        SELECT col_1, col_3 
        FROM main;
        ```

        We are invoking the fucntion `jinjex.switch_schema`, and creating a new table, in that new schema.

        Let's verify that we are now compiling two tables with `sdf compile --show all`. 

        We can also easily confirm the lineage for our new table - *jinjex.private.child* by running `sdf lineage jinjex.private.child`

        ```shell
        Table: jinjex.private.child
        private.child.col_1
        │
        │ copy
        └──────┐
            main.col_1

        private.child.col_3
        │
        │ copy
        └──────┐
            main.col_3
        ```

        Or, if we wanted to execute these SQL statements, you simply run `sdf run`

        ``` shell
        Table jinjex.pub.main
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
        | col_1 | col_2 | col_3 | col_4 |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
        | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
        1 rows.

        Table jinjex.private.child
        +-------+-------+
        | col_1 | col_3 |
        +-------+-------+
        | 1     | 3     |
        +-------+-------+
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
