## Overview

Jinja is a powerful and popular templating engine. SDF uses [Mini Jinja](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/),
a lightweight version of the [Pythonic Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) designed specifically for 
Rust applications. It provides similar functionality to Jinja but is tailored for integration with Rust projects, 
offering enhanced performance.

<Tip>
    SDF comes with Jinja support built-in! No additional installations are required.
</Tip>

## How Does it Work?

Jinja (or Mini Jinja) enables developers to embed logic and dynamic content into static templates. It leverages a unique 
syntax which resembles Python and is added directly to a file:
- Jinja blocks should to be wrapped with `{%` and `%}`
- Jinja variables should be wrapped with `{{` and `}}`

When the file is invoked by the program, in this case SDF, the template gets resolved, changing the file dynamically 
based on the template.

<Note>
    This guide provides a high level overview of Jinja basics. We highly recommend to learn more from the 
    [official Jinja documentation](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/) and other sources online.

## Common Templating in Data Pipelines

### Variables
Let's look at a simple example to make this more concrete. For simplicity, let's assume we know 
`table_name = orders`:

<Tip>
    In the code blocks below, toggle between the queries jinja templates and the rendered versions
    of the queries. The rendered versions of the queries are the ones that will be compiled and 
    executed by SDF.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```sql Jinja Template
SELECT *
FROM {{ table_name }}
```
```sql Rendered File
SELECT *
FROM orders
```
</CodeGroup>

In order for this to work, we need to define the `table_name` Jinja variable. This is done using a `set` block:
<CodeGroup>
```sql Jinja Template
{% set table_name = 'orders' %}
SELECT *
FROM {{ table_name }}
```
```sql Rendered File
SELECT *
FROM orders
```
</CodeGroup>

### If Statements
Let's make it more interesting. If the environment name is 'dev', we want to query `dev_orders`, otherwise, `orders`.
For that, we can use an `if` Jinja block. Notice, we need to close the `if` block with a `endif` block

<CodeGroup>
```sql Jinja Template
{% if builtin.environment == 'dev' %}  
    {% set table_name = 'dev_orders' %}
{% else %}
    {% set table_name = 'orders' %}
{% endif %}
SELECT *
FROM {{ table_name }}
```
```sql Rendered File in Dev
SELECT *
FROM dev_orders
```
```sql Rendered File not in Dev
SELECT *
FROM orders
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    SDF has many built-in Jinja variables that can be accessed in your models. Specifically, `builtin.environment` 
    returns the environment name of the current environment.
</Note>

### For Loops
Jinja supports advanced data structures like lists and dictionaries. Notice that similarly to `if` statements,
`for` loop blocks need to end with `endfor` blocks.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Jinja Template
{% set columns = ['order_id', 'customer_id', 'order_type'] %}
SELECT 
    {% for column_name in columns %}
        {{ column_name }},
    {% endfor %}
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM orders
GROUP BY 
    {{ columns|join(', ') }}
```
```sql Rendered File
SELECT 
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_type,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM orders
GROUP BY 
    order_id, customer_id, order_type
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    Jinja supports some Python native methods. For example, the `join` method of lists as can be seen in the 
    example above.
</Note>

Now, let's see how to iterate on a dictionary:

<CodeGroup>
```sql Jinja Template
{% set columns = {
    'id': 'order_id', 
    'uid': 'customer_id', 
    'type': 'order_type'
    }
 %}
SELECT 
    {% for column_name, column_rename in columns|items() %}
        {{ column_name }} AS {{ column_rename }},
    {% endfor %}
    ...
FROM orders
```
```sql Rendered File

SELECT 
    id AS order_id,
    type AS order_type,
    uid AS customer_id,
    -- ...
FROM orders
```
</CodeGroup>

Another way to iterate on dictionaries is to iterate directly on its keys:
<CodeGroup>
```sql Jinja Template
{% set columns = {
    'id': 'order_id', 
    'uid': 'customer_id', 
    'type': 'order_type'
    }
 %}
SELECT 
    {% for column_name in columns %}
        {{ column_name }} AS {{ columns[column_rename] }},
    {% endfor %}
    ...
FROM orders
```
```sql Rendered File

SELECT 
    id AS order_id,
    type AS order_type,
    uid AS customer_id,
    -- ...
FROM orders
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    Mini Jinja syntax differs slightly from Pythonic Jinja, but it will still meets
    all your Jinja needs. 
    
    For example, although iterating over dictionaries is slightly different, both 
    libraries can implement the same logic with minor adjustments.
</Note>
