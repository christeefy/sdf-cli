title: "Cloud Deployment"
---

To deploy your data catalog to the SDF Cloud, you use the integrated `sdf push` command. The SDF cloud operates similar 
to an infrastructure as code platform (like Terraform). An SDF workspace is packaged up so that code and metadata such as lineage information
can be displayed remotely.

`push` allows you to search, monitor your assets in a visual, interactive manner. 

<Note>
The SDF Cloud is only available via inquiry with our team at this time. If you'd like to get access, please [inquire](https://sdf.com/inquiries)
</Note>

## Deploying Your Workspace

Deploying your workspace is easy. All of the flags associated with the [sdf compile](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-compile) also work with push, but push has a few extra functionalities and tweaks to watch out for. Let's take a look at the following example:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Authenticate Your CLI to SDF Cloud">
    First, we'll authenticate to SDF Cloud.
    ```shell
    sdf auth login
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Let's create a sample project with the sample `deploy_sample`
    ```shell
    sdf new deploy_sample
    ```
    
    SDF Cloud organizes workspaces by `name`. In the workspace.sdf.yml file, rename your workspace to somethng fun! (Note: must be a valid SQL identifirer).
    ```yaml
    workspace:
      name: [YOUR_NAME_HERE]
      ...
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Now, let's push our tables to the SDF Platform. 
    ```shell
    sdf push
    ```

    After a successful deploy, the CLI will provide to you URL for your cloud workspace.
    </Step>
