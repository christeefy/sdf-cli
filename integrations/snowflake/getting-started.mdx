  "Getting started with Snowflake and SDF."

## Overview

SDF can hydrate table schemas and execute queries against a Snowflake DB. This guide will walk you through the steps of creating a Snowflake integration. By the end, you will be able to reference tables in your snowflake instance in SDF.

SDF will use remote Snowflake schema information to do type bindings and other static analysis checks on your workspace.

## Prerequisites

In order to connect to Snowflake, you will need to have on hand the following:

1. A Mac or Linux with a valid installation of the latest SDF version running locally.
2. A Snowflake account to connect to.
3. Valid credentials with read access to materialize tables in your Snowflake account.

## Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Collect Required Information">
        To connect to Snowflake, you need the following materials:
        * Account ID - the 8 digit organization identifier
        * Username - your Snowflake username
        * Password - your Snowflake password
        * Role - a role with appropriate permissions
        * Warehouse - The warehouse you are connecting to.

        Log in to your [Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/) account to find the relevant information.

        <Note>
	        Run `sdf auth login snowflake --help` to see all login options.
        </Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect SDF to Snowflake">
        Connect SDF to snowflake. SDF will prompt you for your Snowflake password.
        ``` shell
        sdf auth login snowflake --account-id <ACCOUNT_ID> --username <USERNAME> --role <ROLE> --warehouse <WAREHOUSE_NAME>
        ```
        
        <Info>
        This will create a new [credential](/reference/sdf-yml#block-credential) in a `~/.sdf/` directory in the root of your system. This credential will be used to authenticate with AWS services. By default, the 
        credential's name is default. As such, the credential does not need to be explicitly referenced in the provider configuration below.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Snowflake Provider in Workspace">
        Once authenticated, add a table provider block in your `workspace.sdf.yml`. This tells SDF to use Snowflake to hydrate missing table schemas.
        ``` yml
        workspace:
            ...
            providers:
                - type: snowflake
                  sources: 
                    - pattern: <DATABASE>.*.*
        ```

        Replace `<DATABASE>` with the name of the database you want to hydrate. Note this is configurable and can be changed to any database you have access to. For example, if I wanted SDF to pull from two databases, called `db1` and `db2`, I would write:
        ``` yml
        workspace:
            ...
            providers:
                - type: snowflake
                  sources: 
                    - pattern: db1.*.*
                    - pattern: db2.*.*
        ```

        Providers can also be configured to use specific credentials by referencing the credential name in the provider block. For example, if you wanted to use a credential called `snowflake-creds`, you would write:
        ``` yml
        workspace:
            ...
            providers:
                - type: snowflake
                  credential: snowflake-creds
                  sources: 
                    - pattern: db1.schema1.mytable
                    - pattern: db2.schema2.*
        ```

        For more information on provider configuration, see the [provider documentation](/guide/transformation/providers).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Try it out!">
        Now that you're connected, let's make sure SDF can pull the schema information it needs. 

        Run `sdf compile -q "select * from <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.<TABLE>" --show all`

        If the connection is successful, you will see the schema for the table you selected.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The term 'DATABASE' in Snowflake is interchangeable with the term 'CATALOG' in SDF.

## Next Steps 

Now that you have connected to Snowflake, you can start materializing tables in Snowflake. Check out the [Snowflake materialization](/integrations/snowflake/basic-materialization) guide to get started.
