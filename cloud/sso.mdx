## Single Sign-On (SSO) Support

SDF supports the following single sign-on (SSO) providers:

- Google
- Okta

<Warning>
  Okta SSO is supported through a single tenant at the moment. This means SDF's Okta account manages all users and groups, and SDF must add and manage new users on behalf of the organization. 
  Support for custom Okta SSO via SAML is coming soon.
</Warning>

<Note>
  If the email used to sign in matches an email added to an existing organization, you will automatically be added to the organization. If not, a new organization will be created for you.
</Note>

## Authenticating with SSO

### Google

SDF supports basic "Continue with Google". To authenticate with Google, click the "Continue with Google" button on the login page.

This should take you to the Google authentication page, where you can sign in with your Google account.

After signing in here, you should be redirected back to the SDF Cloud Console and be logged in.

### Okta

SDF supports Okta SSO through SDF-managed Okta accounts. As such, you'll need to contact SDF in order to have accounts added and managed to the Okta organization.

**SAML configuration to bring your own Okta organization is not currently supported.**

To authenticate with Okta, click the "Continue with Okta" button on the login page.

This should take you SDF's Okta authentication portal, where you can sign in with the Okta account SDF has provided to you.

SDF's Okta sign in portal is hosted at `dev-53333193.okta.com`. After signing in here, you should be redirected back to the SDF Cloud Console and be logged in.
