## Submit a Support Request

Our team at SDF is here to ensure all issues and problems are handled as quickly as possible. 

Three ways to interact with our support team are as follows:

- Submit a support request via the [SDF Support Page](https://www.sdf.com/support) 
- Send an email to [support@sdf.com](mailto:support@sdf.com)
- Create a bug or issue with the appropriate [open source library](#our-open-source-libraries)

## Best Practices for Support Request Submissions

The following are the best practices for submitting support requests:

- Indicate Urgency and Priority
- Be Descriptive
- Include Logs and Code Snippets

### Indicate Urgency and Priority

The support team at SDF has multiple types of criticality and expected response/resolutions
 times that are tracked. The team follows a tiered ranking of criticality from P1 to P4.

| Level | Title | Description | 
| :---       |      :----:        | :----:        |
| P1 | Critical Impact | Any Error which makes the use or continued use of the subscription or material features impossible. Subscription is not operational, with no alternative available |
| P2 | High Impact     | Feature failure, without a workaround, but the subscription is operational |
| P3 | Medium Impact   | Feature failure, but a workaround exists and can be implemented |
| P4 | Low Impact      | Error with low-to-no impact on access to or use of the subscription - or - General question - or - feature enhancement request |

### Be Descriptive 

The more information you can provide about the issue you're experiencing, the quicker SDF support can 
start the troubleshooting and resolution process. When submitting a support request, please include the following information:

- Have you made any recent changes to your workspace or datawarehouse?
- What methods of resolution or solutions have you already tried?
- Is this a problem in more than one workspace?
- Is the error code provided not descriptive?

### Include Logs and Code Snippits

Providing specifics about the workspace and cached files is critical to reproducing and diagnosing the issue/problem. 
To aid our support team in understanding the problem, please provide as much detail and code snippits as possible. 

### Our Open Source Libraries

SDF has multiple open source libraries to reference. Each is available for additional contributions and open for reporting
bugs and issues. Some of these can be found at the following:

- [SDF CLI Documentation, examples, benchmarks, and schemas](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sdf-cli)
- [SDF Workspace Evaluator](https://github.com/sdf-labs/workspace-evaluator)
- [SDF Action](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sdf-action)
- [SDF SQL Functions](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sql-functions)
