    The ClickBench benchmark is designed to evaluate the performance of database systems using a dataset and queries derived from the real-world use cases of ClickHouse, 
    a leading analytical database. This benchmark aims to measure how well different database systems handle large-scale analytical workloads.

    To run the benchmark:
    1. Run the included hydrate.sh script which downloads relevant data
    2. To execute all queries: `sdf run --no-cache`
