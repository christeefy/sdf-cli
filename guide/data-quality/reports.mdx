## Understanding Reports
Reports are a useful way to track & analyze datatypes, metadata, and business logic throughout your data warehouse. Reports are expressed as SQL queries against the SDF Information Schema, similar to [Checks](/guide/checks). Since reports are generated with Static Analysis, executing them is fast.
Reports are simply small SQL queries that run against the information schema and enable you to analyze your warehouse and metadata. Some examples of effective reports are:

 - Analyze Privacy Compliance: Get a list of all tables and columns that contain PII
 - Create a Data Deletion Report: Improve your data deletion capabilities by tracking retention and writing a report to find all tables that contain PII and are past their retention period.
 - Run a Dead Column Analysis: Optimize your warehouse by computing a list of all columns that have no dependencies, then remove them to save on storage and compute costs.
<Note>
  A report is very similar to a check. A check is a specialized report where the expected result of the report is empty.
  In this way, reports can be thought of as variables reflecting the state of your warehouse. These variables can then be used to power a check. 
</Note>
## Writing Your First Report
Let's write and modify a report, starting with one of the sdf samples.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new SDF Project">
    ```shell
    sdf new --sample pii_saas_platform
    ```

```shell
    Created pii_saas_platform/.gitignore
    Created pii_saas_platform/classification/taxonomy.sdf.yml
    Created pii_saas_platform/classification/users.sdf.yml
    Created pii_saas_platform/contracts/no_pii_in_external.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/ddls/payment/public/invoices.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/ddls/payment/public/organizations.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/ddls/payment/public/users.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/reports/tables_with_pii.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/src/external/invoice_stats.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/src/external/org_invoice_stats.sql

    Created pii_saas_platform/src/internal/users_per_domain.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/src/internal/users_per_org.sql
    Created pii_saas_platform/workspace.sdf.yml
   Finished new in 0.003 secs

```
    This sample contains a report and a workspace modeled after a simple SAAS platform.

    Notice the report in the `reports` directory. This report simply lists all tables with PII. It's configured in the `workspace.sdf.yml` file with [includes type](/reference/sdf-yml#enum-includetype) `report` on line 16 like so:
    ```yml
    workspace:
      name: hello
      ...
      includes:
        ...
        - path: reports
          type: report
    ```

    The report itself lists all tables with PII by fetching all columns with classifiers that have `PII`. This is done with the following SQL:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      t.table_ref, 
      t.description, 
      t.dialect
    FROM 
      sdf.information_schema.tables t
    JOIN 
      sdf.information_schema.columns c ON t.table_ref = c.table_ref
    WHERE c.classifiers LIKE '%PII%'
    GROUP BY 1,2,3;
    ```

    <Info>
      Both checks and reports must be written in the Presto SQL dialect.
    </Info>

    This report will show us tables that contain PII only because we defined a classifier like so:
    ```yml
        classifier:
        name: PII
        labels: 
          - name: name
          - name: email
          - name: phone
    ```

    As such, this report will show tables that contain columns with any instance of the PII classifier (i.e. `PII.name`, `PII.email`, or `PII.phone`).

    <Note>
      SDF stores the `classifiers` on a column as a string. As such, we can use the SQL `LIKE` operator to search for a substring.

```

    As you can see from the output, it looks we have three tables containing columns with PII. Let's say we also wanted to show the names of the columns that contain PII. We can do this by modifying the SQL query to include the column name like so:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      t.table_ref, 
      c.column_name,
      t.description, 
      t.dialect
    FROM 
      sdf.information_schema.tables t
    JOIN 
      sdf.information_schema.columns c ON t.table_ref = c.table_ref
    WHERE c.classifiers LIKE '%PII%'
    GROUP BY 2,1,3,4;
    ```

    Now, when we run the report, we can see the column names as well:
    ```shell
    sdf report --show all
    ```
```shell

```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New Report">
    Let's say we'd like to extend our analysis a bit but still maintain the original report. We can do this by adding a new report to the `reports` directory. Let's add a new report to find the most frequently used datatypes in columns with PII. We can do this with the following SQL:
    ```sql pii_datatypes.sql
      SELECT c.data_type, COUNT(*) as frequency
      FROM sdf.information_schema.columns c
      WHERE c.classifiers LIKE '%PII%'
      GROUP BY c.data_type 
      ORDER BY frequency DESC;
    ```
    Now, when we run the report, we can see the most frequently used datatypes in columns with PII:
    ```shell
    sdf report --show all
    ```
```shell
Working set 12 model files, 3 .sdf files
Working set 2 report files, 1 .sdf file
  Reporting sdf.reports.pii_datatypes (./reports/pii_datatypes.sql)

Report sdf.reports.tables_with_pii
+----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------+-----------+

+----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------+-----------+
| transformations.external.invoice_stats       | email        |                         | snowflake |
| payment.public.users                         | email        | DDL for the users table | snowflake |
| payment.public.users                         | phone        | DDL for the users table | snowflake |

| transformations.external.invoice_stats       | name         |                         | snowflake |

```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Output (Optional)">
    We can save the output of a report to a file by using the `--format` flag. Let's save the output of our reports to a file called `sdf_reports.csv`:
    ```shell
    sdf report --format csv --show result > sdf_reports.csv
    ```
    <Note>
      Note that we used `--show result` to only show the result of the report, not any output regarding the execution of the report. In a scenario where you'd want to programatically generate valid CSVs or JSONs of your reports, this is necessary to avoid any extraneous output. See [our input and output guide](/guide/io) for more on this.
