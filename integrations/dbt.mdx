## Overview

This guide will take you through the steps to integrate SDF with an existing DBT project. SDF currently works with DBT `v1.7.0` and above.

- [Example](#example)
- [Commands](#commands)

<a name="example"></a>
## Example 
This first section will walk you through the steps to integrate SDF with an existing DBT project. We'll use the `jaffle_shop` example project from DBT to demonstrate this.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed and configured locally before beginning.

- [DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation)
- [SDF](/guide/install)
- A valid `profiles.yml` file configured wth DBT. See [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) for more information.

Next, you'll need the `dbt-core` Jaffle Shop example project setup locally. You can clone it from [here](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop?tab=readme-ov-file).

<Warning>
	Without a valid `profiles.yml`, the Jaffle Shop example will not be able to compile, and SDF will not work.
</Warning>
<Info>
	We use this example as it doesn't require authentication to a database or existing warehouse. In a production scenario, you'd likely compile DBT with your own models and remote warehouse, requiring authentication. To use SDF in this context, check our [authentication](/guide/authentication) page to see if we support your warehouse. If not, DDLs can be manually added to SDF alongside the DBT project to enable SDF compilation.

## Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compile DBT">
		`dbt compile` will compile the DBT project and generate the manifest file. This must be run first before SDF can work.

		```shell	
		dbt compile
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Initialize the SDF DBT Workspace">
		Using the next command, SDF will create a `workspace.sdf.yml` based on your DBT project's configuration. This file will be placed adjacent to your `dbt_project.yml` file and should be committed to your repository.	

		```shell
		sdf dbt init
		```

		Notice that your `workspace.sdf.yml` [includes block](/reference/sdf-yml#nested-element-includepath) points to files within the `target` directory. This is because SDF deals with raw SQL directly and not DBT models. 
		To accomplish this, SDF copies the necessary compiled DBT models into the `sdf` directory with `target/compiled` (or your configured `target-path`).

		This command will also compile DBT snapshots into a format SDF can understand, and it will configure SDF to work with your DBT seeds. It will add these DBT seed configurations to the `workspace.sdf.yml` file like so:

		```yaml
		...
		table:
			name: raw_orders
			location: seeds/raw_orders.csv
			file-format: csv
			with-header: true

		---
		table:
			name: raw_payments
			location: seeds/raw_payments.csv
			file-format: csv
			with-header: true

		---
		table:
			name: raw_customers
			location: seeds/raw_customers.csv
			file-format: csv
			with-header: true
		...
		```

		All SDF needs to know is the name of the table, the location of the file, and the file format. From there, it can infer the schema and data types. As new seeds are added, simply running `sdf dbt refresh` will update the `workspace.sdf.yml` file with the new seeds. Seeds can also be configured manually according to the YAML specification for [SDF Table Blocks](/reference/sdf-yml#block-table)
	</Step>
	<Step title="Compile SDF">
		Now that we have our `workspace.sdf.yml` file configured, we can compile SDF. This will generate the column level lineage and place it in the `.sdfcache` directory local to your DBT project. 

		```shell
		sdf compile
		```

		Great, now that we have our lineage, let's try adding some metadata to our models.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Classify a DBT Model">
		In our jaffle shop example, we have a table created from a dbt seed called `raw_customers`. This table contains two columns (`first_name`, `last_name`) with personally identifiable information (PII). Let's classify these columns as `PII` in SDF, and ensure any downstream usage of these columns also inherits this classification.

		First, let's define our PII classifier in the `workspace.sdf.yml` file. 

		```yaml
		---
		classifier: 
			name: pii
			description: Personally Identifiable Information
			labels: 
				- name: name
				  description: An individual's first, middle, or last name
		```

		Next, let's attach this to the right columns `raw_customers` table in the `workspace.sdf.yml` file.

		```yaml
		---
		table:
			name: raw_customers
			location: seeds/raw_customers.csv
			file-format: csv
			with-header: true
			columns:
				- name: first_name
					classifiers:
						- pii.name
				- name: last_name
					classifiers:
						- pii.name
		```

		Great, now let's compile SDF again and see what happens.

		```shell
		sdf compile --show all
		```

		```yaml
		Working set 6 model files, 1 .sdf file
        Finished 8 models [8 reused] in 0.089 secs

Schema jaffle_shop.dbt_alice.raw_customers

| first_name              | varchar   | pii.name   |
| last_name               | varchar   | pii.name   |
| first_order             | date      |            |

| customer_lifetime_value | bigint    |            |
+-------------------------+-----------+------------+
```

		You'll notice the classification is not only attached to the `raw_customers` table, but also to the downstream `customers` table and others. This is because SDF is able to infer the lineage between these two tables and propagate the classification.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Deploy & Explore the Lineage (Optional)">
		Now that we have our lineage and metadata generated, we can deploy it to the SDF cloud and explore it in the UI. Note this is only available to users who have been granted access to the SDF Cloud Console.

		```shell
		sdf auth login
		```

		```shell
		sdf push
		```
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Commands 
Here we layout the `sdf dbt` commands available for us when developing with SDF and DBT locally.

### `sdf dbt init`
This command will initialize the SDF workspace for your DBT project. It will create a `workspace.sdf.yml` file adjacent to your `dbt_project.yml` file. It will also configure all DBT seeds and compile DBT snapshots into a format SDF can understand. Lastly, it will copy the compiled models into the `sdf` directory with `target/compiled` (or your configured `target-path`).

```shell
sdf dbt init
```
```shell
Initialize a sdf workspace from a dbt project -- best effort

Usage: sdf dbt init [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --target <TARGET>                Use this DBT target over the default target in profiles.yml
      --profiles-dir <PROFILES_DIR>    Use this DBT profile instead of the defaults at ~/.dbt/profile.yml -- (note dbt uses --profile_dir, this CLI uses --profile-dir)
      --workspace-dir <WORKSPACE_DIR>  Specifies the workspace directory where we expect to see manifest and dbt project files The SDF workspace file will be placed in the same directory. Default: current directory
  -n, --no-save                        Skip saving and overwriting the workspace file
  -c, --config <CONFIG>                Supply a config yml file or provide config as yml string e.g. '{key: value}'
  -h, --help                           Print help

```

<Warning>
	`dbt compile` must be run before running `sdf dbt init`
</Warning>

### `sdf dbt refresh`
This command will refresh the SDF workspace for your DBT project. This is useful if you make changes to DBT models during development, then would like to ensure SDF works with your latest models without regenerating the `workspace.sdf.yml` file. It will recompile the DBT snapshots and move the compiled models into the `sdf` directory with `target/compiled` (or your configured `target-path`).

```shell
sdf dbt refresh
```
```shell
Re-initialize a sdf workspace from a dbt project -- best effort

Usage: sdf dbt refresh [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --target <TARGET>                Use this DBT target over the default target in profiles.yml
      --profiles-dir <PROFILES_DIR>    Use this DBT profile instead of the defaults at ~/.dbt/profile.yml -- (note dbt uses --profile_dir, this CLI uses --profile-dir)
      --workspace-dir <WORKSPACE_DIR>  Specifies the workspace directory where we expect to see manifest and dbt project files The SDF workspace file will be placed in the same directory. Default: current directory
  -n, --no-save                        Skip saving and overwriting the workspace file
  -c, --config <CONFIG>                Supply a config yml file or provide config as yml string e.g. '{key: value}'
  -h, --help                           Print help

```

By default, `sdf dbt refresh` will make changes to your `workspace.sdf.yml` in order to reflect any updates to your DBT project. However, in certain cases when you want to preserve things like comments in your `workspace.sdf.yml` file, for this you can use the `--no-save` flag.
This will output the changes to the `workspace.sdf.yml` file to the console, but not save them to the file.

```shell
sdf dbt refresh --no-save
```

## Conclusion

SDF can work alongside an existent DBT project to power column-level lineage, SQL compilation and validation, impact analysis, data classification, and much more for DBT models. This integration is actively under development, with tons more coming soon.
