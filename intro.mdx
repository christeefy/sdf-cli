## Overview

SDF is a **command-line engine** that includes a multi-dialect SQL compiler, static analyzer, dependency manager, and build cache for **running SQL queries** against
data stored **locally or in the cloud**. SDF works best when paired with the SDF Cloud. You can ask for beta access to the cloud service at **[https://sdf.com/inquiries](https://sdf.com/inquiries)**.

For a more detailed overview, read the [announcement here](https://blog.sdf.com/p/introducing-sdf-the-semantic-data).

In contrast to traditional query engines which can only locally optimize a
single query, **SDF ingests all queries, Code Contracts, and metadata at once**.
SDF then builds code level dependencies, time level dependencies, and
access-level dependencies. SDF also automatically caches intermediate results to dramatically speed up execution. This generational leap in data processing allows for warehouse scale optimizations, AI data classification and automated propagation, multi-engine targeting, and even data use policies to be expressed over a single control plane.

SDF has **data governance**, **column-level lineage** and **Code Contracts**
built-in. Applying Code Contracts requires two user inputs: first, you
establish **policies** that should be upheld; second, the user has to add
**classifiers** to root tables. After that, `sdf` takes over: it automatically
**propagates** the classifiers at analysis time over all queries and workflows,
and on each access it **enforces** the requested policies by query rewriting,
or - if that is impossible - restricts access to the data.

And, SDF is fast. All executions are automatically cached and intermediates are
optimally reused. This means that `sdf` only executes the minimal number of
queries to recompute the requested data. Guaranteed.

## Engine & Platform

The **SDF Engine** is most powerful when paired with the **SDF Cloud**. The cloud platform deploys a workspace as a production data service.
- Visualize end to end column-level lineage on a beautiful, WebGL rendered canvas
- Generate a configuration-free detailed data catalog
- Classify your data with AI
- Easy Cloud Authentication and Single Sign On
- Scale with configurable isolated cluster sizes

SDF allows you to keep your data where it is, and even re-use your existing compute engine. 

<Note>
Note `sdf` is powered by [DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion), for which we have the greatest appreciation.
