  "Integrate SDF into more complex workflows with pre and post hooks"
---

SDF supports execution of arbitrary `scripts` which can be executed via the `sdf exec` command. In this way, you may string multiple commmands together, sequentially.

`scripts` is a reserved name keyword in the `config` yml block. Each property in scripts will be an independently executable command. 

To execute any script run: `sdf exec [SCRIPT_NAME]`

Keep in mind:
- If a subcommand exits with an error code, SDF will propagate that error code, and exit with that same error code
- SDF pipes both `stdout` and `stderr` from subcommands 
- Scripts are run via the `sh` shell. Color coding will *not* be preserved.

### Getting Started
To configure a custom script, add a `scripts` element to the `config` block. Each element in the `properties` array will become a separately executable command.

``` yaml
---
config:
  name: scripts
  description: My custom scripts
  properties:
    my_script: "echo 'hello world'"
    other_script: "echo $USER"
    macro_script: "echo {{env_var('PWD')}}" # needs preprocessor: jinja
```

You are now able to execute these scripts as:
- `sdf exec my_script`
- `sdf exec other_script`
- `sdf exec macro_script`

### Reserved Script Keywords: Pre-Compile, Pre-Run, Post-Compile & Post-Run
In addition to generic scripts, SDF has 4 reserved keywords which will execute scripts natively as part of `sdf compile` and `sdf run` commands.

- `pre-compile` -> When executing `sdf compile` or `sdf check` or `sdf report`, the script in pre-compile is executed first
- `post-compile` ->  When executing `sdf compile` or `sdf check` or `sdf report`, the script in post-compile is executed after compile has successfully finished
- `pre-run` -> When executing `sdf run` or `sdf test` or `sdf stats`, the script in pre-run is executed first
- `post-run` -> When executing `sdf run` or `sdf test` or `sdf stats`, the script in post-run is executed after run has successfully finished


#### Example
The configuration below utilizes all 4 keywords. Let's add it to the default workspace from `sdf new`

``` yaml
---
config:
  name: scripts
  description: Below are the 4 reserved keywords for scripts
  properties:
    pre-compile: >
      echo "RUNNING PRE-COMPILE"
    post-compile: >
      echo "RUNNING POST-COMPILE"
    pre-run: >
      echo "RUNNING PRE-RUN"
    post-run: >
      echo "RUNNING POST-RUN"
```

When executing `sdf compile`, we now run the pre-compile script first, and then post-compile resulting in the below output.

``` shell
> sdf compile
  Working set 1 model file, 1 .sdf file
         Info Executing pre-hook
  RUNNING PRE-COMPILE
    Compiling cfg.pub.main (./models/main.sql)
         Info Executing post-hook
  RUNNING POST-COMPILE
     Finished 1 model [1 succeeded] in 0.270 secs
```

### Use Cases
Scripts allow for organization specific workflows
- Pre-hooks and Post-hooks -> Run custom logic before or after an SDF command
- Metadata uploading -> Upload SDF's information schema to a database for further processing.
- Post processing -> Parse metadata for post-run statistics
- Validate results -> Run python, js, shell, or any other process to validate that current changes fit with your current data infrastructure.

### User & Root User
Scripts inherit the user of the calling SDF process. As a result `sudo sdf exec ...` will run subcommands as sudo as well.

See the below script to validate whether an SDF script is root.

``` yaml
---
config:
  name: scripts
  properties:
    is_root: >
      if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
        then echo "Not running as root"
      else 
        echo "Running as root"
      fi
```
