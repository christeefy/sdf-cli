    Hello World! Let's analyze the world population.

    To build using the local population data (./local/pop.csv), run using the 'local' environment: 'sdf build --profile local'

    To pull data from s3 (s3://sdfdatasets), build using the remote environment: 'sdf build --profile remote'

    (Note: You may need to log into your aws cli before building from remote. Use 'sdf auth aws --profile <PROFILE-NAME>')

    Type 'sdf compile' to view schema information

    Type 'sdf auth login' and 'sdf deploy --profile <local|remote>' to deploy the workspace to the sdf console
