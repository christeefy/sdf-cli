### January 10th, 2023

We are excited to announce that a new release of our CLI is now available, bringing some exciting updates and improvements to SDF.

### What's New?

#### Bug Fixes

- `PIVOT/UNPIVOT` support for Redshift
- `CREATE VIEW` column identifier syntax support in Snowflake
- `primary key` identifier syntax support in Snowflake

#### Forward Lineage Enabled

Issues with forward lineage have been fixed. This will show lineage for all downstream usages of a column. Example usage as follows: 

- `sdf lineage <catalog>.<schema>.<table> --column <column-name> --forward`
