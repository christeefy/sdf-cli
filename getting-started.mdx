title: "Getting Started"
description: We're glad to see you here. Today we're going to install SDF and create a hello world project. Let's get started.
---

## Installing SDF
Installation is currently by invitation only. If you'd like to try SDF, please [request a demo](https://www.sdf.com/inquiries).

### Verify Installation

To verify that SDF is installed correctly, run the following command:

```shell
sdf --help
```

```shell
SDF's multi-dialect SQL compiler and governance framework

Usage: sdf <COMMAND>

Commands:
  new      Create a new sdf workspace
  clean    Remove artifacts that sdf has generated in the past
  compile  Compile models
  run      Run models
  test     Test contracts for models
  report   Report stats for models
  build    Runs models, tests contracts, reports stats
  ai       Infer metadata like classifiers and add them optionally to the workspace
  lineage  Display lineage for a given table and/or column
  push     Push a local workspace to the SDF Service
  pull     Pull a remote workspace from the SDF Service
  system   System maintenance, install and update
  auth     Authenticate CLI to services like SDF, AWS, OpenAI, etc
  man      Display reference material, like the CLI, dialect specific functions, schemas for authoring and interchange
  dbt      Initialize an sdf workspace from an existing dbt project
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

```

For more on installing SDF, see [Install SDF](/guide/install). 

## Creating a Project

To create a new project, run the following command:

```shell
sdf new --sample hello
```
After running the command, you should see the following output: 
 
```shell
    Created hello/.gitignore
    Created hello/src/main.sql
    Created hello/workspace.sdf.yml
   Finished new in 0.003 secs

```

This will create a new directory with the name of your project. In this case, that's `hello`.
The directory will contain an `workspace.sdf.yml` file, which is the main configuration file for your project. For more on this, see our [workspaces guide](/guide/workspaces).
Your new directory will also contain a `src` directory with a `main.sdf` file, which is the entry point for your project and the sql file we'll be statically analyzing and executing locally.
Next, let's take a deeper look at your project.

## Exploring Your Project

Next we'll run the core command of SDF: [sdf compile](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-compile). 
Describing our project will *statically* analyze the query and tell you about the table schemas and column-level lineage. Building will run the query locally right on your machine.
Let's give them a go.

First we'll try `sdf compile`
  
```shell
cd hello/
sdf compile
```

```shell
Working set 1 model file, 1 .sdf file
  Compiling hello.pub.main (./src/main.sql)
   Finished 1 model [1 succeeded] in 0.206 secs

```


As you can see from the output, SDF has statically analyzed the query and determined there's a single non-nullable column named `column` and it's of type `varchar`. 
You'll also see an empty `classifier` block in the output. This is for metadata we'll attach to columns, but we'll get to that later.

In this guide we showed you just how easy it is to install SDF and run your first query.
