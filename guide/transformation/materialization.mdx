## Overview

SDF's static analysis unlocks a whole suite of features and new data development paradigms alone, but its usefulness is amplified
when used in tandem with runtime materialization. Runtime materialization works against remote warehouses and the local SDF database alike. High-level materializing with SDF helps you:

- Materialize models as views, tables, incremental tables, transient tables, temporary views, recursive tables, and more. 
- Debug faster when running your models, since static analysis will check errors before running them.
- Run tables with Jinja, SQL Variables, or other relevant metadata without converting them to your compute's SQL.

All materialization functionality is part of the [sdf run](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-run) command since we are dealing with the output of SQL queries. 

## Materialization Prerequisites

### Prerequisites
In order to materialize tables in your data warehouse, you will need to have the following:

1. A machine with the latest SDF version running locally.
2. A Snowflake or Redshift warehouse to materialize tables remotely.
3. Valid credentials with write access to materialize tables in your warehouse.
4. A configured [provider](/guide/transformation/providers) in your workspace.sdf.yml file.

As such, we recommend starting with our [providers documentation](/integrations/providers) before proceeding with materialization.

## Materialization Guides

Below are a list of follow-along guides to help you get started with materialization in SDF. Since materialization differs between warehouses, each guide walks you through a specific materialization type in a specific warehouse.

| Materialization Type | Snowflake                           | Redshift |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -----------------|
| View     | [Link](/integrations/snowflake)       | [Link](/integrations/redshift) |
| Table      | [Link](/integrations/snowflake)     | [Link](/integrations/redshift) |
| Incremental   | [Link](/integrations/snowflake)  | [Link](/integrations/redshift) |

<Info>
  SDF supports a wide variety of materialization options. See the [materialization config](/reference/sdf-yml#enum-materialization) to view them all.
