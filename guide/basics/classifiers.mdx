  "SDF promotes reasoning on higher level types through a rich data classification & type system. "

SQL only supports primitive types like `varchar`, `int`, `timestamp`, `decimal`, etc. But, people reason over higher level data types. A varchar might be a name, or phone numbr. An integer might be a daily active user metric.

SDF has the ability to annotate columns and tables with **user defined types** and then **propagate** those types to downstream assets while respecting aggregations, or functional transformations of data. This
unique capability fosters the creation of a *dynamic semantic layer* which adapts with you as build out your data warehouse. 

Classifiers are first-class citizens of the SDF ecosystem. And, since they are metadata on top of SQL, they are completely compatible with all dialects and databases that SDF supports.

You can think of them like rich types in a language like Typescript. They can be defined, reused, transformed, and propagated programatically by SDF. Let's dive in.

<Note>
SDF uses the term *Classifier* and *SQL Type* interchangeably. Any column or table may be 0 or more classifiers.
</Note> 

## Using SQL Types & classifiers

**What are popular examples of SQL Types?**
- Personally Identifiable Information like phone numbers, addresses, etc.
- Metrics 
- Financial Information
- Unique Identifiers 
- Retention Requiremenets
- Time Grains

**What Can You Do With SQL Types?**
- Write Reports
- Write Checks
- Audit
- Prevent Business Logic Mismatch
- Ensure Consistency Across Metrics
- Customer Segmentation

Higher order types have many advantages.

## Basic Propagation

Propagation is the mechanism of inferring the downstream column types from
the upstream column types. The inference process is based on the semantics of
the underlying transformation.

<Note>
In the following example, the `lineage` sample workspace is used. If this workspace is not already
set up, it can be created with an `sdf new --sample lineage` command.
</Note>

### Defining a Classifier Taxonomy

To work with classifiers and propagation we must first define all the relevant
classifier domains. Here is an example of a simple PII classifier domain,
defined in a separate section of the global `workspace.sdf.yml` config file.

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  edition: "1.2"
  includes:
    - path: src/
---
classifier:
  name: PII
  labels:
    - name: Phone
    - name: Address
    - name: SSN
    - name: UID
```

This configuration defines five A top level type `PII` with 4 labels: `PII.Phone`,
`PII.Address`, `PII.SSN`, and `PII.UID`, where the last four labels denote
special classes of the first label. (I.e. if some data is labeled with
`PII.Address`, it is also, implicitly, labeled with `PII`.)

<Note>
Classifier domains can also be defined in separate `sdf.yml` files as long as
these files are included by the `workspace.sdf.yml` file as one of the
paths specified in `includes`.
</Note>

### Attaching Classifiers to Tables

Once a classifier domain is defined, we can manually attach classifiers to
tables. Once root tables are annotated with the relevant classifiers, SDF
automatically propagates classifiers downstream.

Let's start by labeling our `source`. We add a new file (`src/source.sdf.yml`) containing our type:

```yaml src/source.sdf.yml
table:
  name: source
  columns:
    - name: user_id
      classifiers:
        - PII.UID
    - name: phone
      classifiers:
        - PII.Phone
```

This file will automatically be picked up by SDF because the workspace already includes the `/src` directory. Alternatively, the same configuratin can be included
directly into the workspace.sdf.yml file as follows:

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  edition: "1.2"
  includes:
    - path : src/
---
classifier:
  name: PII
  labels:
    - name: Phone
    - name: Address
    - name: SSN
    - name: UID
–--
table:
  name: source
  columns:
    - name: user_id
      classifiers:
        - PII.UID
    - name: phone
      classifiers:
        - PII.Phone
```

Notice - all .sdf.yml files are composable! You may include one or more configuration in any .sdf.yml file, as long as the schmea is respected.

### Inspecting Propagation Results

To see the classifer, and how it was propagated to all tables downstream of our `source` table, run `sdf compile --show all`.

```bash
sdf compile --show all
```

```text

| qty         | bigint    | false       |            |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+------------+

| phone       | varchar   | false       | PII.Phone  |
| txn_date    | varchar   | false       |            |
| qty         | bigint    | false       |            |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+------------+
```

Observe how the classifiers attached to the upstream table automatically
propagated downstream to `middle` and `sink`, but not to `knis` – because it
doesn’t have any columns derived from the `PII` columns upstream.

## Advanced Propagation

By default classifiers propagate through functions unchanged. For example, if a
substring is extracted from a column labeled as `PII.phone`, the result
will also be labeled with `PII.phone` by default. 

However, the result is no longer a phone number - maybe it's just the area code!

Let's imagine the result of the substring expression is only area codes. We can use a [function block](/reference/sdf-yml#block-function) in our `sdf.yml` files to define the behavior of a classifier in response to the function being called.

In our current example, we'd want to reclassify `PII.phone` to `PII.area_code`. Here's the function overload required to do so:
```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
---
function:
  name: substring
  reclassify:
    - from: PII.phone 
      to: PII.area_code
```

Great! Now every time the substring function is called on a column with the classifier `PII.phone`, it will be reclassified to `PII.area_code`.

Another common case is to _prevent_ a classifier from propagating through an aggregation. For example, if a column `user_id` is labeled with the classifier `PII.UID` and we `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` from the table containing this column, we don't want `PII.UID` to propagate since the `COUNT DISTINCT` is not a `PII.UID`. It's a number representing the unique count of `PII.UID`s. We can use the same `reclassify` block to prevent this propagation. Here's an example:
```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
---
function:
  name: count
  parameters:
    - datatype: T
  returns:
    - datetype: bigint
  reclassify:
    - from: PII.UID
```

By explicitly not setting a `to` value in the `reclassify` block, we remove the `PII.UID` classifier downstream and achieve our desired behavior.

<Note>
Function reclassifications work across all queries by default. In this way, developers have full programmatic control over how their classifiers propagate and interact with functions across their entire data warehouse.
</Note>

Lastly, this same reclassification mechanism can be used on a single column or table using the same `reclassify` block. Here's an example below:

```yaml src/phone_trimmed.sdf.yml
table:
	name: phone_trimmed
	columns:
		- name: phone_first_three_digits
	reclassify:
		- from: PII.phone
			to: PII.area_code
```

In this example, the column `phone_first_three_digits` will be reclassified to `PII.area_code` if it is derived from a column with the classifier `PII.phone`.

### Classifier States

Using _labels_, classifiers can also exist in states that communicate how the data is currently represented.


Here is how a classifier state could be defined in YML:

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
...
---
classifier:
  name: PII_STATE
  labels:
    - name: clear_text
    - name: hashed
    - name: anonymized
...
```

`PII_STATE.clear_text` is meant to represent human-readable PII, and `anonymized` is meant to represent anonymized PII. We can then use these states to define the effect of functions (including [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/guide/udf)) on classifiers like the examples above. For example, we can define the effect of an `md5` hash as follows:


```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
---
function:
  name: md5
  reclassify:
    - from: PII_STATE.clear_text
      to: PII_STATE.hashed
```

Now let's imagine we have a UDF called `anonymize` which anonymizes PII no matter its current state. For this, we can use a glob pattern (e.g. `*`) to tell SDF to reclassify a `PII_STATE` classifier no matter its current state. Here's an example:

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
---
function:
  name: anonymize
  parameters:
    - name: pii
      datatype: varchar
  returns:
    - datatype: varchar
  reclassify:
    - from: PII_STATE.*
      to: PII_STATE.anonymized
```

Note the usage of `PII_STATE.*` in the `from` field of the `reclassify` block. This tells SDF to reclassify any `PII_STATE` classifier, no matter its current state, to `PII_STATE.anonymized`.

<Info>
  Wondering why we also defined the `parameters` and `returns` in this function block? This is because this function is a [`User Defined Function (UDF)`](/guide/udf). For more on function signatures, see the [UDF](/guide/udf) guide.

### Organizing Classifiers

When organizing classifiers, it is recommended to create a folder to host all Classfiers created by you and your team.
Setting up a location within the working directory called `classifiers` is the recommended setting.
Once created, this location will need to be ammended to the `workspace.sdf.yml` so that it is included.

```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
---
includes:
  - path: classifiers/
```
