### July 8th, 2024

We are excited to announce that a new minor release of our CLI is now available, bringing
 improvements, new features, and bug fixes to SDF. Interested in our product roadmap or want to 
discuss features? Reach out to your SDF point of contact to provide any points of feedback!

### Documentation

[Adding Custom Tests](/guide/data-quality/tests#add-custom-tests) This new guide provides information on
 how to write custom tests that utilize our built-in testing infrastructure to run custom testing macros.

### General bug fixes and stability improvements:
- Introduced `--targets-only`. This feature enables more granular execution of model subsets. Imagine a scenario where your Airflow tasks run DAGs defined by your directory structure and you only want to run models present in a single directory.
- Released bug fixes for Snowflake stage references.
