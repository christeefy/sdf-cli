title: "Overview of Function Execution"
---

SDF DB is currently designed to model Trino in semantics and execution. All functions are currently designed for 
1:1 compatiblity with the functions in the Trino Dialect. Function implementation is in Rust, providing for fast execution. 

SDF DB natively uses the Arrow data format for vectorized computation. There are many built-in functions for common operations. 
These functions include, but are not limited to:
- String Functions: UPPER(), LOWER(), CONCAT(), SUBSTRING(), etc.
- Numeric Functions: ABS(), ROUND(), CEIL(), FLOOR(), etc.
- Date and Time Functions: NOW(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(), FORMAT(), etc.
- Aggregate Functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), etc.


### Adding New SQL Functions
SDF DB does not yet support all Trino functions. There are many after all. Functions are implemented on a first-come first-serve basis in the open source 
[sql-functions](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sql-functions) repository.

If you would like a new function, please [Open an Issue](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sql-functions/issues) or contribute the function yourself. 

And, if you'd like to use these functions yourself, they are available as a [rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/sql-functions).

### Known Limitations
SDF DB is in Alpha with many popular Trino features coming soon.

Currently SDF DB is Missing Support For:
* User Defined Functions
* Lambdas
