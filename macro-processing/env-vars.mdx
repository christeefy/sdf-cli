### Referencing Environment Variables
Environment variables can be accessed via the built in jinja macro `env_var(VAR)`. This function is accessible in both SQL, and YML files.

Give it a try:
<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Your Workspace">
        Navigate to your SDF workspace. To create a new one, see our getting started section [here](/getting-started).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Turn on the macro preprocessor">
        SDF will only use the macro-processor when instructed. In your `workspace.sdf.yml`, in the workspace, block,
        add the preprocessor configuration.
        ```yml
            workspace:
              ...
              preprocessor: jinja
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Give it a Try!">
        Now you have access to environment variables. Try if for yourself.
        In your terminal, run an ad-hoc query against SDF:
        ```bash
        sdf run -q "select '{{env_var('PWD')}}' as current_directory;"
        ```
        You'll see as output:
        ```shell
        Table sdf.pub.query
        +---------------------------------------------+
        | current_directory                           |
        +---------------------------------------------+
        | /Users/name/Documents/workspaces/jinja-demo |
        +---------------------------------------------+
        ```
    </Step>
