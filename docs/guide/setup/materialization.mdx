## Overview

Runtime materialization helps to bring your SDF model from a development environment to live tables in production. 
It works against remote warehouses and the local SDF database alike:
- Materialize models as views, tables, incremental tables, transient tables, temporary views, recursive tables, and more. 
- Debug your models faster and at no cost, since static analysis checks errors before running them.
- Run tables with Jinja, SQL Variables, or other relevant metadata without manually converting them to plain SQL.

Materialization is executed as part of [sdf run](/reference/sdf-cli#sdf-run).

## Materialization Prerequisites

### Prerequisites
In order to materialize tables in your data warehouse, you will need to have the following:

1. A machine with the latest SDF version running locally.
2. A Snowflake or Redshift warehouse to materialize tables remotely.
3. Valid credentials with write access to materialize tables in your warehouse.
4. A configured [provider](/guide/transformation/providers) in your workspace.sdf.yml file.

As such, we recommend starting with our [providers documentation](/integrations/providers) before proceeding with materialization.

## Materialization Guides

Below are a list of follow-along guides to help you get started with materialization in SDF. Since materialization differs between warehouses, each guide walks you through a specific materialization type in a specific warehouse.

| Materialization Type | Snowflake                           | Redshift |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -----------------|

<Info>
  SDF supports a wide variety of materialization options. See the [materialization config](/reference/sdf-yml#enum-materialization) to view them all.
