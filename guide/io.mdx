title: "Display, Input and Output"
---

One of the beloved parts of software engineering is how developers have managed to keep their development workflows contained to the terminal. So we thought - why not let the vim and emacs legends of the world develop data workflows in their natural habitat - the terminal. As such, SDF is designed to be a command line tool and can ideally keep the large majority of your data development contained to the terminal (and your IDE of choice). As a byproduct, we take output *seriously*. This guide will take you through how to configure your terminal environment to get the most out of SDF.

<Note>
Simply put, SDF allows you to specify its 
* *display formats*, as part of *CLI* options
* *input file format and location*, as part of an *external table specification*
* *output file format and location*, as part of the *data asset specification*, the latter also via the CLI
</Note>

## Display Options

SDF writes progress or results on stdout. It provides the developer with a variety of logging and output options to enable scripting, debugging, and other use cases.

### Command-line options 

There are 5 commandline options to control the output.

- `--quiet` - Do not print `sdf` progress messages.

- `--no-show` - Do not print `sdf` results, i.e., produced tables.

- `--log (info | trace | debug)` - Print logs in various degrees.

  - `info` prints internal progress, SQL statements being processed, logical
    plan being produced
  - `debug` prints more of the above, cache hits, etc
  - `trace` prints internal state changes

- `--print-format (json | csv | yml | tbl)` - Specifies the table representation
  on stdout.

  - `tbl` is the normal ascii table representation.
  - `csv` is a CSV representation
  - `json` is a JSON representation
  - `yml`, only available for `sdf describe`, is YAML representation

- `--limit number` - Limits the number of shown rows. Run with `--limit 0` to
  show all rows.

### Example

Let's try these options. Start by creating a new workspace with a sample project or change directories into an existing one.

(0) Install and setup your workspace

> `sdf new --sample lineage`

(0.5) Then, cd into the newly created directory

> `cd lineage/`

(1) Usual describe

> `sdf describe`

(2) describe without any progress report. This will also prevent the `Finished in [n] seconds` message from displaying at the end of stdout.

> `sdf describe --quiet`

(3) describe without any table info but with progress info

> `sdf describe --no-show`

(4) describe without any output except errors

> `sdf describe --no-show --quiet`

(5) describe with trace log info

> `sdf describe --log trace`

### Controlling which tables will be printed

`sdf` shows all tables that are explicitly passed as arguments on the commandline. If you pass no input argument, it prints all tables of the workspace.

#### Example (cont.)
(0) Show only the sink table this time via a file

> sdf describe src/sink.sql

(1) Show only the `sink` table this time via a target, i.e. a
_catalog.schema.table_ term

> sdf describe source_to_sink.public.sink

(2) Of course you can pass as many files or targets as you want. Even regex patterns are supported. Use a `*` for example to match all tables in a folder like below.

> sdf describe src\/*.sql

We now discus each of the parameters in turn.

### Schema

The `schema` of an external table must be given **explicitly**, following the [ANSI standard SQL syntax](https://blog.ansi.org/2018/10/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2016-ansi-x3-135/) or

An example for an explicit table definition looks like this

```sql
create external table events (
    dt date not null,
    action varchar not null,
    user_id smallint not null)
    ...
```

Besides column names, types and nullability, SDF schema definitions have no
other schema descriptions, no foreign keys, no constraints.
