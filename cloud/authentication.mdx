## Authenticating the CLI

Before you can deploy your assets to the SDF Cloud, you'll first need to authenticate with the platform. 

<Note>
The SDF Cloud is only available via the **Plus** and above plans at this time. If you'd like to get access, please [inquire](https://sdf.com/inquiries)
</Note>

Authenticating with your CLI is easy. Simply run the command below to begin:

```shell
sdf auth login
```

Next, your default browser will open up and prompt you to login. Currently, Google and Okta are supported authentication providers.

Once you've logged in, you'll be redirected to sucess page:

Congratulations! You've successfully authenticated with the SDF Platform. You can now deploy, monitor, and interact with your assets on the platform.
