<Note>
The JSON schemas for our `.sdf.yml` extension are published on the [schema store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/). The [Red Hat YML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) will out of the box auto-complete and validate your SDF YMLs.

## SDF Versions and Updating

From time to time, it may be necessary to update the CLI to get the latest and
greatest features, or to connect to SDF Cloud Services.

If you've already installed SDF, you can update to the latest version by running
the command below. By default, this will update to the latest version of the
CLI.

```shell
sdf system --update
```

You can check the currently installed version of your CLI with

```shell
sdf --version
```

## Uninstalling SDF

If you ever need to uninstall SDF, simply run

```shell
sdf system --uninstall
```

SDF is currently supported on the following platforms. The executable is small
(\<50mb), but heavily parallelized. As such, SDF's resource consumption is
dependent entirely on your data processing requirements.
