  description:
    This workspace models the DBT / DuckDB Jaffle Shop example project.
    The functionality of both DBT and DuckDB are encapsulated by SDF, as this project can be run entirely locally, with no external dependencies on data or compute providers.

    Try compiling first with `sdf compile`. This validates all SQL and dependencies are correct.
    Then, run everything locally with `sdf run`. This will run the entire DAG locally.
    Lastly, track lineage with `sdf lineage`. Specify the fully qualified name after the command to see lineage for a specific table of column.
