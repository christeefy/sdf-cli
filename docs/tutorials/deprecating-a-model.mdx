title: "Deprecating a Model"
---

## Overview
In the previous tutorial, we discovered `app_installs` was replaced by `app_installs_v2`.

This tutorial will walk through the deprecation of `app_installs` and demonstrate 
how SDF can help overcome the two big hurdles in deprecating a model:
1. Preventing prod from breaking by tracking and resolving downstream dependencies 
2. Setting up guardrails to prevent future mistakes

## Prerequisites
Completion of the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/debugging).

## Setup
### Reference to Metadata Files
SDF's semantic understanding is based on metadata files, defining your custom business 
logic, and smart propagation of values. To get started, we need to reference the metadata 
directory by simply including the relevant paths in our workspace configuration file, `workspace.sdf.yml`. 

Open the file `workspace.sdf.yml` and uncomment the following:

``` yml workspace.sdf.yml
...
# Uncomment here to complete the "Deprecating a Model" tutorial >>>>>>
- path: classifications  # Classifiers
- path: checks  # Checks against SDF's information schema
    type: check
# <<<<<<<
```

<Note>
Note
* The classifications folder contains one YAML file for table classifiers, and one for column classifiers. 
* The metadata folder is structured based on our models folder.
* The checks folder is currently empty. 

We will talk about all of these a bit later.
</Note>

Now, the paths are included in our project.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Before Deprecation">
        Before deprecating a model, we can run impact analysis on the its
        downsltream dependencies using SDF's lineage command. We simply run:

        ``` shell
        sdf lineage app_installs --forward --show result
        ```

``` shell
Table: app_installs

app_installs.campaign_id

app_installs.campaign_name
│
│ copy
└──────┐
       agg_installs_and_campaigns.campaign_name

app_installs.campaign_type

app_installs.customer_id
│
│ mod
└──────┐
       agg_installs_and_campaigns.distinct_installs

app_installs.event_id

app_installs.install_time
│
│ copy
└──────┐
       agg_installs_and_campaigns.install_time

app_installs.platform
│
│ copy
└──────┐
       agg_installs_and_campaigns.platform


        ```
        <Tip>
            **Wow!** The model `agg_installs_and_campaigns` is also using the 
            old version table!
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Classify the Model as Deprecated">
        The file `classifications/table_classifiers.sdf.yml` holds definitions of
        a table level classifier called `TABLE_STATUS`. You can see that one of the
        table status options is `deprecated`.
        
        To add the classifier to our table, navigate to the table's metadata file 
        `metadata/staging/app_installs.sdf.yml`. Remove the commented 
        section assigning the `TABLE_STATUS.deprecated` classifier to the table:

        ```yml metadata/staging/app_installs.sdf.yml
        # Uncomment here to add a "deprecated" classifier to the table
        classifiers:
          - TABLE_STATUS.deprecated
        ```

        Let's compile and see how it looks:
        ```shell
        sdf compile app_installs --show result
        ```


``` shell

Schema moms_flower_shop.pub.app_installs
       This table is a staging table which adds campaign information to app install events

       [TABLE_STATUS.deprecated]

        ```
        
        <Tip>
            Read more about classifiers in the [Classifiers Guide](/guide/basics/classifiers).
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Prevent Using Deprecated Tables">
        To prevent this issue from repeating itself, we can create an [SDF check](/guide/data-quality/checks)
        that will fail every time a deprecated table is referenced.

        Create a new SQL file called `deprecated_table_reference.sql` in the 
        `checks/` directory. Copy the following query to your new file:

        ``` sql checks/deprecated_table_reference.sql
        WITH
        deprecated_tables AS (
            SELECT
                table_id,
                table_name
            FROM sdf.information_schema.tables 
            WHERE 
                CONTAINS(classifiers, 'TABLE_STATUS.deprecated')
        )

        SELECT 
            t.table_name AS table_name, 
            d.table_name AS upstram_deprecated_table_name,
        FROM sdf.information_schema.table_lineage tl
            JOIN deprecated_tables d 
                ON (d.table_id = tl.from_table_id)
            JOIN sdf.information_schema.tables t
                ON (t.table_id = tl.to_table_id)
        ```

        Thanks to SDF's lineage, we already knew that `agg_installs_and_campaigns` 
        is referencing the old table. Therefore, it's a good test to our check - 
        we expect it to fail.
        
        Let's check it out (pun intended):

        ``` shell
        sdf check deprecated_table_reference
        ```


``` shell
[Fail] Check moms_flower_shop.pub.deprecated_table_reference
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+
| table_name                 | upstram_deprecated_table_name |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+
| agg_installs_and_campaigns | app_installs                  |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+
1 rows.

        ```

        It works! Now, we should fix `agg_installs_and_campaigns`.
        <Tip>
            To get a health check of our warehouse, we can create reports that
            will aggregate our checks for us. For more details, look at our 
            [Reports Guide](/guide/data-quality/reports).
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Resolve Downstream Dependencies">
        To make sure we won't break prod if we delete our table, we
        can choose to resolve the dependency by either: 
        
        * Deleting the file `models/analytics/agg_installs_and_campaigns.sql` 
        representing the model
        * Updating the `FROM` statement like we did for our previous model:
        
        ``` sql models/analytics/agg_installs_and_campaigns.sql
        ...
        FROM app_installs_v2  -- Change from app_installs to app_installs_v2
        ...
        ```

        Let's run our check again:
        ```
        sdf check deprecated_table_reference
        ```

        All clear!

``` shell
[Pass] Check moms_flower_shop.pub.deprecated_table_reference

        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

That was really cool, ha? Let's explore what other cool things we can 
do with SDF's information scehma and semantic undersstanding in our 
next tutorial - [enriching your warehouse](/tutorials/enriching-your-warehouse)
