### June 30th, 2024

We are excited to announce that a new minor release of our CLI is now available, bringing
 improvements, new features, and bug fixes to SDF. Interested in our product roadmap or want to 
discuss features? Reach out to your SDF point of contact to provide any points of feedback!

### Better support for local sources, performance improvements, and table & column descriptions propagate to Snowflake

New fix added for local sources when utilizing `sdf run`. `sdf run` now works when specifying local sources 
and remote targets. It won't download schemas from Snowflake if they are already defined locally. 

10x faster schema download from Snowflake. Fixes a bug related to removing remote schemas 
and fixes tests that were incorrectly designated test_remote.

Table and column descriptions in `.sdf.yml` files are now propagated up to Snowflake via the materialized query. 
This change was accomplished via the [open source materializations lib](https://github.com/sdf-labs/materialization/blob/main/macros/macros/materialize.jinja#L26).

### SDF Now Supports Snowflake Stage Path Syntax

Introduce jinja macros: gen_comments and gen_column_comments that ensure tables with comments 
in an sdf.yml will be materialized with the comments in Snowflake.

### Workspace Level Credentials

Introducing workspace level credentials for the SDF Cloud. Inside `Workspace Settings` administrators 
can now Create, Manage, and Delete credentials for AWS and Snowflake. To read more access the [workspace 
credentials docs](/cloud/workspace_credentials).

### Documentation

[Snowflake Snapshots](/integrations/snowflake/snapshots) - This guide describes how to 
materialize snapshot models in Snowflake. The goal of snapshots is to capture and preserve the state of your data 
at specific points in time, allowing you to track historical changes and perform time-based analyses.

### General bug fixes and stability improvements:
- Fix relative bug issues and add tests
- Onboarding screen general fixes
- `Recompile` no longer required for `PushWorkspace` task
- Catalog page fixes 
- Refactor TableName to eliminate no quote hacks and no panic
