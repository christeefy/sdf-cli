### April 12, 2024

We are excited to announce that a new major release of our CLI is now available, bringing
 improvements, new features, and bug fixes to SDF. Interested in our product roadmap or want to 
discuss features? Reach out to your SDF point of contact to provide any points of feedback!

### Migrate from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

With the new minor release multiple breaking changes have been applied with workspace version 1.2. 
Detailed documentation on each specific feature is coming soon. To migrate and take advantage of these
new features, follow these instructions to update your `workspace.sdf.yml` and other workspace YML files 
as needed:
- [Migrate from 0.1.x to 0.2.x](/releases/migrations/11-12)

#### Breaking Change: New Provider Block Configuration

We've updated our provider blocks in the `.sdf.yml` to more explicitly separate tables being read remotely 
(i.e. remote pull down of DDLs) and tables being written to. This makes it easier to configure RBAC 
for read only access to production databases and read/write to sandbox databases. 

Versions v0.2.5 and above will require the following update to your provider block. For more information
reference the [New Provider Configuration](/releases/migrations/11-12#new-provider-configuration).
``` yml workspace.sdf.yml
integrations:
  - provider: snowflake
    type: database
    credential: snowflake_credentials
    sources: 
      - pattern: prod_db.priv.*
    targets:
      - pattern: prod_db.pub.*
        rename-as: dev_db.pub.$1
```

#### Specify Compile Environments and Systematic Renaming
SDF now supports environments and systematic renaming. You can now run SDF queries against 
your developer schemas and production schemas within the same CLI by simply specifying the 
`-e` or `--environment` flag in your `sdf run` command. 
<Note>
You'll need to define the renaming scheme and environment details in an SDF YML environment block. 

We recommended checking out the [SDF YML Reference Guide](/reference/sdf-yml)
</Note>


#### Materialization 
SDF now supports materialization! This can be set with the materialization parameter. Valid 
materializations include table, view, temporary table, materialized view, and more. Support for 
incremental materialization is coming soon. [Materialization Reference](/reference/sdf-yml#enum-materialization)

#### Credential Blocks within SDF YML
SDF now supports a credential block in SDF YML. This enables you to manage multiple credentials 
with SDF, and use them across environments and providers.

#### Group Defaults and Enhanced Workspace Configuration
Defaults are now more easily configurable. Instead of a default-prefix for all these separate fields, 
SDF now groups them all under one defaults block that's configurable at the workspace, environment, and include-path level.

#### Renaming of Checks and Reports
In an effort to simplify our nomenclature, we've renamed Code Contracts to Checks and Code Reports 
to Reports. 2 words -> 1 word for each. We call that a success story.

### General bug fixes and stability improvements:
- General log fixes from `sdf auth login`
- Fix credential errors
- Improve metadata query performance from providers
