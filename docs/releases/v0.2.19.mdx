### Basic Materialization and Incremental Materialization

Two new docs cover the process of materializing your tables and views in Snowflake with SDF:

- [Basic Materialization](/integrations/snowflake/basic-materialization)
A guide to materialize your first tables and views in Snowflake with SDF. Utilize datasets from 
our partner, Cybersyn, to bootstrap some example data through Snowflake's data marketplace.

- [Incremental Materialization](/integrations/snowflake/incremental-materialization)
Build on the basics with incremental materialization of models in Snowflake using SDF.
