### April 28th, 2023

<p>We are excited to announce that a new release of our CLI is now available, bringing some exciting updates and improvements to SDF.</p>

<p>With this new release, you can expect to see faster performance, improved reliability, and a range of new functionality that we know you'll love. In addition to these new features, we've also made a number of smaller improvements and bug fixes that will enhance the overall user experience.</p>

### What's New?
- AWS Redshift Support 
- New path for creating a new sample `sdf new --sample hello`
- Parser now ignores statements if they are not implemented
- SDF support for function blocks declared in `sdf.yml` files
- CLI outputs multiple errors (rather than failing on the first error)
- Support for the `--no-exec` flag on `sdf deploy`. This prevents the deployment from being executed in the cloud, but still generates column-level lineage and propagates classifiers.
